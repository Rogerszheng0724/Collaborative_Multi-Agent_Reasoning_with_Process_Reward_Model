1,Moderator,"Debate Topic: In-depth discussion based on the mission context and ideas from ROT and LOT. Mission Context (partial): Instruction: What external strategies do elites employ?  Context: The following are multiple choice options:[An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants., Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met., An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats., Weak states may sometimes militarily engage in action to bolster their regional position and to mobilize internal support against the construction of an imagined external threat. This frequently coincides with economic or social crises as a policy of distraction.]... Initial Core Idea from ROT (partial): Okay, here's the complete response, addressing the refined requirements:  **Response:**  Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include: expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  *   **Expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders:** The motivation behind this strategy is often to reduce competition for scarce resources and jobs, and to foster nationalistic sentiment, potentially diverting attention from internal problems. Actions involve implementing stricter visa requirements, mass deportations, and increased border security. Consequences can include short-term economic gains and reduced social unrest, but also long-term labor shortages, damage to international relations, and a potential brain drain.  *   **Avoiding alliances with powerful states:** Elites may choose this strategy to maintain autonomy and avoid being dominated or controlled by a stronger power. Actions include refusing to participate in military alliances, diversifying trade partners, and pursuing a neutral foreign policy. While this can preserve sovereignty, it can also lead to isolation, a lack of access to resources and protection, and vulnerability to external threats.  *   **Employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries:** This strategy is often employed to supplement weak national armies, suppress internal dissent, or conduct operations that the state is unwilling or unable to undertake directly. Actions involve hiring foreign mercenaries and contracting PMCs for security, training, and even combat roles. Consequences can include increased security and suppression of opposition, but also potential human rights abuses, erosion of state legitimacy, high costs, and a dependence on external actors.  *   **Military engagement to bolster regional position:** Elites may engage in military actions to increase prestige and influence, control valuable resources, or project power in the region. Actions include launching military interventions in neighboring countries, supporting proxy wars, and increasing military spending. While this can lead to increased regional power and control of resources, it can also result in international condemnation, economic strain, domestic instability, and entanglement in protracted conflicts.... Initial Detailed Plan from LOT (partial): Aggregated result from layer 267 (Concept: 'Generate and present the answer based on the plan...') using strategy 'all_content_ranked': - (Criterion: 'Criterion A (Level 1): Synthesize the concise justifications, vulnerabilities, international norm constraints, corruption impacts, domestic political influences, resource control motivations, information warfare usage, and significant risks for each strategy into a single, coherent paragraph for each of the four strategies, suitable for direct inclusion in the synthesized answer', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include: ""expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders,"" ""avoiding alliances with powerful states,"" ""employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries,"" and ""military engagement to bolster regional position.""  **Expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders:** Weak state elites may expel foreign workers to reduce competition for scarce resources and jobs, bolstering domestic support and consolidating control. Restricting borders allows for tighter control over the flow of goods, people, and information, limiting dissent and potentially increasing revenue through customs and smuggling. However, this can lead to international condemnation, economic disruption due to labor shortages, and increased vulnerability to transnational criminal networks. Corruption can exacerbate these issues, as border restrictions create opportunities for bribery and illicit trade. Domestically, this strategy can be popular initially but may lead to resentment if it significantly harms the economy.  **Avoiding alliances with powerful states:** Elites in weak states may avoid formal alliances with powerful states to maintain autonomy and prevent external interference in domestic affairs. This allows them to balance relationships with multiple actors and avoid being beholden to any single power. However, this strategy can leave the state vulnerable to aggression from stronger neighbors or non-state actors. International norms of sovereignty provide some protection, but powerful states may still exert influence through economic or political pressure. Resource control motivations may influence this strategy, as elites seek to maintain control over valuable resources without external interference. A significant risk is isolation and lack of support in times of crisis.  **Employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries:** Weak state elites may employ private military companies (PMCs) and foreign mercenaries to bolster their security forces, suppress dissent, and protect key assets. This can be particularly attractive when domestic forces are unreliable or lack the necessary skills. However, reliance on PMCs and mercenaries can undermine state legitimacy, fuel corruption, and lead to human rights abuses. International norms prohibit the use of mercenaries in certain circumstances, and their presence can destabilize the region. Domestically, this can lead to resentment and further erode trust in the government. Significant risks include loss of control over security forces and dependence on external actors. Information warfare can be used to justify the presence of PMCs by portraying them as essential for national security.  **Military engagement to bolster regional position:** Elites in weak states may engage in limited military interventions to enhance their regional influence, divert attention from domestic problems, or secure access to resources. This can involve supporting proxy groups, engaging in border skirmishes, or intervening in neighboring countries. However, such actions can provoke retaliation, destabilize the region, and strain already limited resources. International norms of non-interference are often violated, leading to condemnation and sanctions. Corruption can fuel these conflicts, as elites profit from arms deals and resource exploitation. Domestically, military engagement can be popular initially but may lead to disillusionment if it becomes costly or unsuccessful. A significant risk is escalation into a larger conflict.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion B (Level 1): Rewrite the introduction to explicitly state the main objective and the four strategies, ensuring it flows naturally and sets the stage for the detailed explanations', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion C (Level 1): Combine the paragraphs created in Criterion A into a single, cohesive answer that directly addresses the prompt and the multiple-choice options', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  Expulsion of foreign workers and border restrictions are used to control access to resources and limit potential dissent. By reducing the competition for jobs and resources, elites can appease their core supporters. However, this can lead to economic disruption and international condemnation.  Avoiding alliances with powerful states allows weak states to maintain their autonomy and avoid becoming pawns in larger geopolitical games. While it reduces the risk of direct intervention, it also limits access to potential aid and protection, making them vulnerable to other threats.  The employment of private military companies (PMCs) and foreign mercenaries provides elites with a loyal and capable security force, often circumventing the need to rely on potentially unreliable national armies. However, this can undermine state sovereignty, create a culture of impunity, and exacerbate internal conflicts.  Military engagement to bolster regional position can be used to project strength and deter potential rivals. This can involve interventions in neighboring countries or participation in regional conflicts. While it can enhance prestige and influence, it also carries the risk of escalation, resource depletion, and international isolation.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion D (Level 2): Review the synthesized answer for redundancy and grammatical errors, ensuring clarity and conciseness', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  Expulsion of foreign workers and border restrictions aim to strengthen national identity and control resource distribution, potentially leading to economic disruption and international condemnation. Avoiding alliances with powerful states allows weak states to maintain autonomy and avoid being drawn into conflicts, but it can also limit access to resources and security guarantees. Employing private military companies and foreign mercenaries provides security and military capacity without relying on potentially disloyal domestic forces, though this can lead to accountability issues and exacerbate internal conflicts. Finally, military engagement to bolster regional position can enhance prestige and access to resources, but risks overextension and provoking stronger powers.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion E (Level 2): Add a concluding sentence that summarizes the overall impact of these strategies on weak states', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  Expulsion of foreign workers and border restrictions are used to reduce competition for resources and jobs, thereby placating domestic populations and strengthening elite control. This can lead to xenophobia and economic disruption. Avoiding alliances with powerful states allows weak states to retain autonomy and avoid being dominated by larger powers, but it can also limit access to resources and security guarantees. The employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries provides elites with a loyal security force, bypassing unreliable national armies and suppressing dissent, though at the cost of sovereignty and potential human rights abuses. Finally, military engagement to bolster regional position can enhance prestige and control over resources, but risks overextension and conflict with stronger neighbors.  Ultimately, while these strategies may offer short-term gains for elites, they often undermine long-term stability and development within weak states.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion F (Level 3): Explore alternative phrasing for each section to maximize impact and readability, focusing on active voice and strong verbs', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  *   **Expulsion and Border Restriction:** Driven by a desire to control resources and reduce perceived threats to their power, elites may expel foreign workers to limit competition for jobs and resources. They restrict borders to control the flow of people and goods, hindering potential opposition movements and maximizing revenue through customs. This action can lead to international condemnation and economic disruption.  *   **Alliance Avoidance:** To maintain autonomy and avoid being dominated by stronger powers, elites in weak states often avoid formal alliances with powerful nations. They prioritize non-alignment or carefully balanced relationships, preventing any single power from exerting undue influence. This strategy can leave them vulnerable to external threats but preserves their independence.  *   **Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Mercenaries:** Lacking strong domestic security forces, elites may employ PMCs and foreign mercenaries to suppress internal dissent and protect their regime. These actors provide security without relying on potentially disloyal domestic forces. However, this reliance can undermine state legitimacy and create a culture of impunity.  *   **Military Engagement:** Elites may engage in limited military interventions to bolster their regional position and project an image of strength. This can involve supporting proxy groups or intervening in neighboring conflicts to secure resources or expand influence. Such actions can escalate regional tensions and destabilize the region.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion G (Level 3): Consider adding a brief example for each strategy to illustrate its application in a real-world scenario (if possible, given the constraints of conciseness).', Level: 1):   Elites in weak states employ external strategies to consolidate power, control resources, and maintain autonomy. These strategies include expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders, avoiding alliances with powerful states, employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries, and military engagement to bolster regional position.  *   **Expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders:** This is often driven by the desire to control resources and patronage networks, eliminating competition from foreign labor and consolidating economic power within the elite's circle. Actions include enacting restrictive immigration policies, mass deportations, and increased border security. Consequences can include economic disruption due to labor shortages and strained international relations. *Example: Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina, ostensibly aimed at clearing slums, also targeted foreign workers and informal traders, consolidating control over resources and markets.*  *   **Avoiding alliances with powerful states:** This strategy aims to maintain autonomy and prevent undue influence from external actors. Actions involve diversifying international partnerships, non-alignment policies, and resisting binding agreements. Consequences can include limited access to resources and security guarantees from major powers, but also greater freedom of action. *Example: Myanmar's historical reluctance to fully align with either China or the West, seeking to maintain its independence.*  *   **Employment of private military companies (PMCs) and foreign mercenaries:** This tactic provides security and military capabilities without relying on potentially disloyal or weak domestic forces. Actions include contracting PMCs for training, security, and even combat operations. Consequences involve high financial costs, potential human rights abuses, and undermining the legitimacy of the state's own security apparatus. *Example: Several African nations have utilized PMCs for counter-insurgency operations and resource protection.*  *   **Military engagement to bolster regional position:** This involves using military force to project power, secure resources, or create buffer zones. Actions include cross-border raids, support for proxy groups, and territorial disputes. Consequences can include regional instability, international condemnation, and escalation of conflicts. *Example: Eritrea's involvement in conflicts in Somalia and Ethiopia, aimed at securing its regional influence and access to resources.*  ... The debate will now commence focusing on these ideas."
2,ROT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the ROT_Representative:  **1. Elaboration on the ROT Idea and its Strengths**  My core idea directly addresses the prompt by identifying and explaining four key external strategies employed by elites in weak states:  *   **Expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders:** This strategy focuses on internal control by limiting external influences and consolidating resources. *   **Avoiding alliances with powerful states:** This emphasizes maintaining autonomy and preventing external domination. *   **Employment of private military companies and foreign mercenaries:** This addresses security concerns and regime survival when internal forces are unreliable. *   **Military engagement to bolster regional position:** This highlights the use of external aggression to consolidate power and resources.  **Key Strengths:**  *   **Directness:** The response directly answers the question by identifying four specific strategies. *   **Clarity:** Each strategy is clearly defined, with motivations, actions, and consequences outlined. *   **Comprehensive:** The response covers a range of external strategies, from economic and social control to security and military actions. *   **Balanced:** Each strategy is presented with both its potential benefits and drawbacks. *   **Concise:** The response is focused and avoids unnecessary jargon or complexity.  My approach is preferable because it offers a clear, concise, and balanced overview of the key external strategies employed by elites in weak states. It provides a solid foundation for further analysis and discussion.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the LOT Idea**  The LOT idea, derived from an aggregated result of multiple criteria, is generally strong, but it also has some weaknesses and limitations when compared to my ROT idea.  **Strengths of the LOT Idea:**  *   **Depth of Analysis:** The LOT idea dives deeper into the justifications, vulnerabilities, and consequences of each strategy, including considerations like corruption, international norms, and domestic political influences. *   **Real-World Examples:** The inclusion of examples like Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina, Myanmar's non-alignment, African nations' use of PMCs, and Eritrea's regional interventions adds concrete illustrations to the strategies. *   **Refined Phrasing:** The LOT idea demonstrates a commitment to clear and impactful language, utilizing active voice and strong verbs. *   **Concluding Summary:** The LOT idea's concluding sentence effectively summarizes the overall impact of these strategies on weak states.  **Weaknesses and Limitations:**  *   **Potential for Overcomplexity:** While the depth of analysis is a strength, it also risks overwhelming the reader with too much information. The initial paragraphs derived from Criterion A, while comprehensive, are quite dense. *   **Redundancy:** The LOT idea goes through multiple iterations (Criterion C, D, E, F, G). While refinement is good, some iterations only offer minor improvements and could be seen as redundant. *   **Loss of Initial Simplicity:** The initial simplicity and directness of identifying the four strategies are somewhat diluted by the subsequent layers of analysis. The core answer becomes buried within the details. *   **Focus on Negative Consequences:** While acknowledging potential benefits, the LOT idea tends to emphasize the negative consequences and risks associated with each strategy, potentially creating a biased perspective. *   **Uneven Application of Examples:** While the examples are helpful, their integration could be smoother. They sometimes feel tacked on rather than seamlessly woven into the analysis.  **Why My ROT Approach Might Be Preferable:**  *   **Accessibility:** My ROT idea prioritizes accessibility and clarity, making it easier for the reader to grasp the core concepts quickly.

In summary, while the LOT idea offers a more detailed and nuanced analysis, my ROT idea provides a clearer, more accessible, and more balanced overview of the key external strategies employed by elites in weak states. The ROT idea is preferable for its efficiency and its ability to provide a strong foundation for further exploration of the topic. It directly addresses the prompt without getting bogged down in excessive detail."
3,LOT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the LOT Representative, addressing the task of elaborating on my detailed plan, highlighting its strengths, and critically evaluating the ROT idea:  **1. Elaboration on the LOT Idea and its Strengths**  My detailed plan directly addresses the prompt, ""What external strategies do elites employ?"" by presenting a comprehensive analysis of four key strategies, which are also reflected in the multiple-choice options provided:  *   **Expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders:** This strategy tackles resource control and internal stability. *   **Avoiding alliances with powerful states:** This focuses on maintaining autonomy and preventing external interference. *   **Employment of private military companies (PMCs) and foreign mercenaries:** This addresses security needs and regime survival. *   **Military engagement to bolster regional position:** This highlights the use of external aggression for power consolidation.  **Key Strengths and Feasibility:**  *   **Comprehensive Analysis:** My plan goes beyond simple identification of strategies. It delves into the *justifications* (resource control, domestic support), *vulnerabilities* (economic disruption, international condemnation), *international norm constraints*, *corruption impacts*, *domestic political influences*, *resource control motivations*, *information warfare usage*, and *significant risks* associated with each strategy. This multi-faceted approach provides a richer, more nuanced understanding. *   **Real-World Examples:** The inclusion of concrete examples like Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina, Myanmar's non-alignment, and Eritrea's regional interventions grounds the analysis in reality and demonstrates the practical application of these strategies. These examples enhance comprehension and credibility. *   **Actionable Detail:** The plan details specific *actions* taken by elites within each strategy (e.g., enacting restrictive immigration policies for expulsion, diversifying international partnerships for alliance avoidance) and the *consequences* that follow (e.g., labor shortages, limited access to resources). *   **Iterative Refinement:** The plan incorporates multiple layers of refinement (Criteria C, D, E, F, and G), ensuring clarity, conciseness, and impactful phrasing. This iterative process strengthens the overall quality of the response. *   **Explicit Introduction and Conclusion:** The introduction clearly states the objective and the four strategies, setting the stage for the detailed explanations. The concluding sentence summarizes the overall impact, providing a cohesive and impactful finish. *   **Feasibility:** The information required to execute this plan is readily available in academic literature, policy reports, and news articles pertaining to weak states and their external relations. The plan is feasible in terms of research and synthesis.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the ROT Idea**  The ROT idea, while strong in its directness and clarity, has several weaknesses compared to my LOT plan.  *   **Lack of Depth:** The ROT idea provides a more superficial overview of each strategy. It identifies motivations, actions, and consequences, but it doesn't delve into the underlying factors that drive these strategies, such as corruption, international norms, domestic political influences, and information warfare. My LOT plan provides a much more complete and nuanced picture. *   **Limited Consideration of Complexities:** The ROT idea acknowledges potential benefits and drawbacks but doesn't fully explore the complex trade-offs and unintended consequences associated with each strategy. For example, it mentions ""short-term economic gains"" from expulsion but doesn't address the long-term damage to international relations or the increased vulnerability to transnational crime. *   **Absence of Concrete Examples:** The ROT idea lacks concrete examples to illustrate the application of these strategies in real-world scenarios. This makes the analysis more abstract and less engaging for the reader. My LOT plan's inclusion of examples significantly enhances its explanatory power. *   **Weaker Integration with Multiple Choice Options:** While the ROT identifies the 4 strategies, the LOT plan directly incorporates the strategies from the multiple choice options into a more detailed and nuanced analysis. This ensures the answer is highly relevant to the context.  **3. Overlooked Aspects and Why the LOT Approach is Preferable**  The ROT idea overlooks several key aspects that are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the topic:  *   **The Role of Corruption:** Corruption often plays a significant role in shaping the external strategies of weak states. Elites may use these strategies to enrich themselves and their allies, even at the expense of the state's long-term interests. The LOT plan explicitly addresses the corruption impacts. *   **The Influence of International Norms:** International norms can constrain the actions of weak states, even when elites are tempted to pursue aggressive or exploitative strategies. The LOT plan acknowledges these constraints. *   **The Use of Information Warfare:** Elites may use information warfare to justify their external strategies and to manipulate public opinion both at home and abroad. The LOT plan mentions this. *   **Domestic Political Influences:** The LOT plan considers domestic political influences in a more nuanced manner, acknowledging that strategies popular in the short term can lead to long term resentment.  My LOT approach is preferable because:  *   **It provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.** By delving into the underlying factors and considering the unintended consequences, it offers a more realistic and insightful analysis. *   **It is more grounded in reality.** The inclusion of concrete examples makes the analysis more engaging and demonstrates the practical application of these strategies. *   **It is more policy-relevant.** By identifying the vulnerabilities and risks associated with each strategy, it provides valuable insights for policymakers seeking to address the challenges facing weak states. *   **It is more aligned with the prompt's implied depth.** The prompt asks ""What external strategies do elites employ?"", which calls for more than just a basic listing. The LOT plan delivers a comprehensive explanation.  In summary, while the ROT idea offers a clear and concise overview, the LOT plan provides a more comprehensive, nuanced, and policy-relevant analysis that is better suited to addressing the complexities of the prompt. The inclusion of real-world examples and the consideration of underlying factors make the LOT plan a superior approach."
4,Critical_Analyst,"Okay, here's my critical analysis of the ROT and LOT ideas regarding the external strategies employed by elites in weak states.  **Evaluation of ROT's Idea:**  *   **Strengths:** ROT provides a clear and concise overview of the four key strategies. It directly addresses the prompt and offers a balanced perspective by acknowledging both the potential benefits and drawbacks of each strategy. The explanations are accessible and easy to understand. *   **Weaknesses:** ROT's analysis lacks depth. While it identifies motivations, actions, and consequences, it doesn't delve into the underlying factors such as corruption, international norms, or domestic political influences. The absence of concrete examples makes the analysis more abstract and less engaging. It also doesn't fully explore the complexities and unintended consequences associated with each strategy. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** ROT overlooks the role of corruption, the influence of international norms, the use of information warfare, and the nuances of domestic political influences in shaping these external strategies. *   **Correctness and Completeness:** The ROT idea is correct in identifying the four main strategies. However, it's incomplete due to the lack of depth and supporting evidence. *   **Improvements/Points of Caution:** ROT should incorporate concrete examples to illustrate each strategy, explore the underlying factors that drive these strategies, and address the potential unintended consequences. It should also consider the ethical implications of these strategies and the impact on human rights.  **Evaluation of LOT's Idea:**  *   **Strengths:** LOT provides a comprehensive analysis of the four strategies, delving into the justifications, vulnerabilities, international norm constraints, corruption impacts, domestic political influences, resource control motivations, information warfare usage, and significant risks associated with each strategy. The inclusion of real-world examples enhances comprehension and credibility. The iterative refinement process ensures clarity and conciseness. *   **Weaknesses:** LOT's depth of analysis can sometimes lead to overcomplexity and redundancy. The initial paragraphs derived from Criterion A are quite dense. While the examples are helpful, their integration could be smoother. It also tends to emphasize the negative consequences and risks associated with each strategy, potentially creating a biased perspective. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** While LOT covers many aspects, it could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the role of external actors in shaping the strategies of weak states. For example, how great power competition can influence these strategies. *   **Correctness and Completeness:** LOT's idea is correct and more complete than ROT's. It provides a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the four strategies. *   **Improvements/Points of Caution:** LOT should strive for greater conciseness and avoid overcomplexity. It should also ensure a more balanced perspective by acknowledging the potential benefits of these strategies. The integration of examples should be more seamless.  **Overall Critique:**  Both ROT and LOT have their strengths and weaknesses. ROT provides a clear and accessible overview, while LOT offers a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis. However, ROT lacks depth and supporting evidence, while LOT can be overly complex and biased.  LOT's approach is preferable because it offers a deeper and more nuanced analysis, supported by real-world examples. However, it needs to be more concise and balanced. ROT's strength lies in its accessibility, but it needs to be more comprehensive.  ### Synthesized Accurate Answer: Elites in weak states employ several external strategies to maintain power and control resources. These include: expulsion of foreign workers and restricting borders to consolidate resource control and limit dissent (e.g., Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina); avoiding alliances with powerful states to preserve autonomy, albeit at the risk of limited support (e.g., Myanmar's non-alignment); employing private military companies and foreign mercenaries for security, despite potential human rights abuses (common in several African nations); and military engagement to bolster regional position, risking international condemnation and conflict escalation (e.g., Eritrea's interventions in Somalia and Ethiopia)."
