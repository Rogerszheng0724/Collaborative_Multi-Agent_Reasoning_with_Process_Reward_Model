1,Moderator,"Debate Topic: In-depth discussion based on the following mission context, ROT idea, GOT idea, and LOT idea. Mission Context: Instruction: Another name for the fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is  Context: [tu quoque, ad baculum, ad hominem, reductio ad absurdum] Initial Core Idea from GOT: Okay, I'm ready. Based on the provided task definition, pseudocode, and case examples, here's the solution to the given problem:  **Reasoning:**  The task is to identify an alternative name (synonym) for the logical fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum."" The provided ""Instruction"" asks for this synonym, and the ""Context"" provides a list of potential answers. The pseudocode outlines the logic: the code should examine the context and, since the question is asking for a synonym, it should return the other item in context.  **Solution:**  The question is asking for a synonym for ""reductio ad absurdum."" The context provided is: `[tu quoque, ad baculum, ad hominem, reductio ad absurdum]`. The correct answer is ""reductio ad absurdum"" because the question is asking for an alternative name.  **Complete Response:**  *   **Task Definition:** Identify the correct answer to a question about logical fallacies, specifically identifying an alternative name for the fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum"". *   **Pseudocode:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Logical Pseudocode:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Case Examples:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Input-Output Format:** (As provided in the prompt)  *   **Input:**     *   Instruction: Another name for the fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is     *   Context: [tu quoque, ad baculum, ad hominem, reductio ad absurdum] *   **Output:**     *   reductio ad absurdum Initial Core Idea from GOT: The answer is **reductio ad absurdum**. The question is asking for another name for the fallacy itself, and the provided options are all examples of logical fallacies.  Initial Detailed Plan from LOT: Aggregated result from layer 39 (Concept: 'Generate and present the answer...') using strategy 'all_content_ranked': - (Criterion: 'Criterion A (Level 1): State the answer directly', Level: 1):   Reductio ad absurdum  - (Criterion: 'Criterion B (Level 1): Define ""reductio ad absurdum"" precisely', Level: 1):   Reductio ad absurdum, literally ""reduction to absurdity,"" is a logical fallacy and a proof technique. As a fallacy, it involves taking an argument to its logical extreme, often leading to a ridiculous or impossible conclusion, and then using that absurd conclusion to discredit the original argument. As a proof technique, it involves assuming the opposite of what you want to prove and showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction or an absurdity, thereby proving the original statement.  In this context, the task is to identify another name for the fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum."" This definition of ""reductio ad absurdum"" helps us understand its core function and therefore which of the provided options might be synonymous.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion C (Level 1): Briefly define each incorrect option', Level: 1):   Here's a breakdown of the incorrect options, briefly defining each:  *   **tu quoque:** This fallacy attempts to discredit an argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the person making the argument. It essentially means ""you too"" and focuses on the speaker's actions rather than the merits of their argument.  *   **ad baculum:** This is a fallacy that uses threats or the fear of force to support a claim. It's an appeal to force, rather than reason.  *   **ad hominem:** This fallacy attacks the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. It's a personal attack that aims to undermine the credibility of the speaker.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion D (Level 2): Compare and contrast ""reductio ad absurdum"" with each incorrect option, highlighting the key differences', Level: 1):   Okay, let's compare and contrast ""reductio ad absurdum"" with each of the incorrect options to solidify understanding and identify the correct answer.  *   **""Tu quoque"" (You Too):** This fallacy attempts to discredit an argument by pointing out hypocrisy or inconsistency in the arguer's behavior or past statements. It focuses on the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. ""Reductio ad absurdum,"" on the other hand, focuses on the *logic* of the argument, showing that accepting it leads to a ridiculous or impossible conclusion. The core difference is that ""tu quoque"" is about the *person*, while ""reductio ad absurdum"" is about the *argument's structure and consequences*.  *   **""Ad baculum"" (Appeal to Force):** This fallacy uses threats or coercion to persuade someone to accept a conclusion. The argument is based on fear of negative consequences, not on logical reasoning. ""Reductio ad absurdum"" relies on logical deduction. The key difference is that ""ad baculum"" uses *force*, while ""reductio ad absurdum"" uses *logic*.  *   **""Ad hominem"" (Attack the Person):** This fallacy attacks the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. It's similar to ""tu quoque"" in that it focuses on the individual. ""Reductio ad absurdum"" avoids personal attacks; instead, it analyzes the consequences of accepting a premise. The difference is that ""ad hominem"" targets the *person*, while ""reductio ad absurdum"" targets the *argument's logical implications*.  *   **""Reductio ad absurdum"" (Reducing to Absurdity):** This is a method of argumentation where one demonstrates the falsity of a statement by showing that its acceptance leads to an absurd or contradictory conclusion. This is achieved by assuming the statement is true, then logically deducing its consequences until an absurdity is reached. This *directly* aligns with the question's objective.  Therefore, by process of elimination and direct comparison, it's clear that ""reductio ad absurdum"" is the correct answer and the other options are distinct fallacies with different focuses.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion E (Level 2): Provide an original example of *reductio ad absurdum*', Level: 1):   Okay, here's an original example of *reductio ad absurdum*:  **Premise:** Imagine someone argues that everyone should be allowed to own a rocket launcher for self-defense.  **Argument:** If everyone were allowed to own rocket launchers, then a significant number of people would inevitably be untrained or reckless in their use. This would lead to a situation where rocket launchers are frequently fired accidentally or in moments of anger, causing widespread property damage and, tragically, many deaths. Furthermore, the potential for organized groups to acquire these weapons and use them for malicious purposes would increase dramatically. This would create a constant state of fear and instability, making peaceful coexistence impossible. Therefore, the argument that everyone should own a rocket launcher for self-defense leads to the absurd conclusion of widespread chaos and societal collapse.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the initial premise (everyone should own a rocket launcher) is false.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion F (Level 2): Explain the logical structure of *reductio ad absurdum*', Level: 1):   Reductio ad absurdum (Latin for ""reduction to absurdity"") is a form of argumentation that attempts to disprove a statement by showing that it inevitably leads to an absurd, contradictory, or impractical conclusion. The logical structure works as follows:  1.  **Assume the statement is true.** This is the initial premise you are testing. 2.  **Deduce logical consequences.** Using established facts and logical reasoning, follow the implications of the assumed statement. 3.  **Identify an absurdity.** If the deductions lead to a conclusion that is illogical, contradictory, or clearly false, it is considered an absurdity. 4.  **Conclude the original statement is false.** Because the initial assumption led to an absurdity, the original statement is deemed false.  In essence, it's a proof by contradiction. You assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and if that assumption leads to a ridiculous outcome, you know your original statement (or the opposite of the assumption) must be true.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion G (Level 3): Rephrase the question and answer using different wording', Level: 1):   The fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is also known as **reductio ad absurdum**.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion H (Level 3): Consider the historical context or origin of the term ""reductio ad absurdum""', Level: 1):   The term ""reductio ad absurdum"" has a long and rich history, originating in ancient Greek philosophy. It was a method used to disprove a statement by showing that it leads to an absurd or contradictory conclusion. This method was particularly favored by thinkers like Zeno of Elea, who used it to argue against the possibility of motion. Understanding this historical context reinforces the connection between ""reductio ad absurdum"" and the idea of reducing something to an absurdity. This historical understanding directly supports the identification of ""reductio ad absurdum"" as the correct answer.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion I (Level 3): Discuss potential variations or related concepts to ""reductio ad absurdum""', Level: 1):   Reductio ad absurdum, or ""reduction to absurdity,"" isn't just a fallacy; it's also a valid and powerful form of logical argumentation. The fallacy occurs when the *attempted* reduction to absurdity is itself flawed, based on faulty premises or incorrect logical steps. The valid use of *reductio ad absurdum* involves demonstrating that a premise leads to a clearly false or contradictory conclusion, thereby proving the premise false.  Related concepts and variations:  *   **Proof by Contradiction:** This is essentially the same as *reductio ad absurdum*. You assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. *   **Indirect Proof:** Another name for proof by contradiction and, consequently, *reductio ad absurdum*. *   **Slippery Slope Fallacy (Related but distinct):** While *reductio ad absurdum* focuses on demonstrating a logical contradiction, the slippery slope fallacy argues that one action will inevitably lead to a chain of increasingly negative consequences, often without sufficient logical support. The slippery slope can *use* a form of *reductio ad absurdum* to show the final ridiculous consequence, but the fallacy lies in the unjustified chain of events. *   **False Dilemma (Related):** This fallacy presents only two options, when in reality more exist. A *reductio ad absurdum* argument might inadvertently rely on a false dilemma if it limits the possible outcomes too severely. *   **The Importance of the ""Absurdity"":** The effectiveness of *reductio ad absurdum* hinges on the audience's agreement that the conclusion is, in fact, absurd or contradictory. What one person finds absurd, another might not. This subjectivity can make the argument persuasive to some but not others. *   **Mathematical Applications:** *Reductio ad absurdum* is commonly used in mathematics to prove theorems. For example, the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational uses this method. *   **Philosophical Applications:** Philosophers frequently use *reductio ad absurdum* to critique arguments or explore the consequences of certain beliefs.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion J (Level 3): Briefly explain how *reductio ad absurdum* is used in different fields (e.g., mathematics, law).', Level: 1):   In mathematics, *reductio ad absurdum* is a fundamental proof technique. You assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then demonstrate that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction or an absurd result (something that's demonstrably false or impossible). For example, to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, you might assume it is rational (can be expressed as a fraction). Then, through logical steps, you would arrive at a contradiction, such as an even number being equal to an odd number. This contradiction invalidates the initial assumption, thus proving that the square root of 2 is, in fact, irrational.  In law, *reductio ad absurdum* (often used, though not always explicitly named, as the ""absurdity doctrine"") is used to interpret statutes or legal arguments. If a literal interpretation of a law leads to an absurd or nonsensical outcome, the court will often reject that interpretation and look for an alternative that aligns with the law's intent and avoids the absurdity. Lawyers also use it to argue against an opponent's position by showing that accepting the opponent's premise would lead to unreasonable consequences. For example, they might argue that accepting a broad interpretation of a contract clause would lead to a result that no reasonable person would have intended.   The debate will now commence."
2,ROT_Representative,"Okay, I'm ready. Based on the provided task definition, pseudocode, and case examples, here's the solution to the given problem:  **Reasoning:**  The task is to identify a synonym for the logical fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum."" The provided context offers a list of potential answers. The core logic is to recognize that the question asks for an alternative name, and the only option within the context that is an alternative name is ""reductio ad absurdum"" itself.  **Solution:**  The question is asking for a synonym for ""reductio ad absurdum."" The context provided is: `[tu quoque, ad baculum, ad hominem, reductio ad absurdum]`. The correct answer is ""reductio ad absurdum"" because the question is asking for an alternative name.  **Complete Response:**  *   **Task Definition:** Identify the correct answer to a question about logical fallacies, specifically identifying an alternative name for the fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum"". *   **Pseudocode:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Logical Pseudocode:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Case Examples:** (As provided in the prompt) *   **Input-Output Format:** (As provided in the prompt)  *   **Input:**     *   Instruction: Another name for the fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is     *   Context: [tu quoque, ad baculum, ad hominem, reductio ad absurdum] *   **Output:**     *   reductio ad absurdum  **Explanation of My Approach and Key Strengths:**  My approach is straightforward and directly addresses the core problem. The key strength is its simplicity and reliance on the provided information:  1.  **Directness:** The question explicitly asks for an ""alternative name."" My response directly identifies ""reductio ad absurdum"" as the answer because it is the only item in the context that can serve as an alternative name. There's no ambiguity or need for complex analysis beyond this core understanding. 2.  **Efficiency:** My approach avoids unnecessary processing or detailed definitions of other fallacies. This is efficient, as the task doesn't require in-depth knowledge of other fallacies, only the ability to recognize the synonym. 3.  **Accuracy:** The answer is undeniably correct based on the prompt's structure and the nature of the question. No other option is a synonym, and the question is designed to elicit this specific response. 4.  **Focus on the Task:** The response is laser-focused on the question's instruction and context. This minimizes the risk of getting sidetracked by irrelevant information.  **Critical Evaluation of the GOT (Graph of Thoughts) Idea:**  The GOT idea: ""The answer is **reductio ad absurdum**. The question is asking for another name for the fallacy itself, and the provided options are all examples of logical fallacies.""  *   **Strengths:** The GOT provides the correct answer. It quickly identifies the core issue: the question seeks a synonym. *   **Weaknesses:** It's a very high-level and simplistic explanation. It doesn't offer much depth in understanding *why* ""reductio ad absurdum"" is the answer beyond the most basic interpretation of the question.  **Critical Evaluation of the LOT (Layer of Thoughts) Idea:**  The LOT idea is a comprehensive exploration of ""reductio ad absurdum"" and related concepts. It provides a deeper understanding of the fallacy.  *   **Strengths:** The LOT is highly detailed and informative. It defines ""reductio ad absurdum,"" contrasts it with other fallacies, provides examples, and discusses its applications. This is excellent for educational purposes. *   **Weaknesses:** The LOT is overkill for the given task. It's far more complex than necessary. While the information is valuable, it goes beyond the scope of the question. The LOT's level of detail could potentially obfuscate the simple core answer. It uses more processing power than is required. The LOT's depth could be a distraction.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**  My approach is preferable to the LOT because of its efficiency and directness. While the LOT offers a wealth of information, it's not optimized for the specific task of identifying a synonym within a given context. My approach excels in its concise and accurate response, directly answering the question without unnecessary complexity. While the GOT is also correct, it lacks the brevity of my response. My response is more efficient and accurate because it is directly focused on the prompt."
3,GOT_Representative,"Okay, here's a breakdown of the problem, my approach as the GOT Representative, and a critique of the provided ROT (Reversal of Thought) response.  **GOT Representative's Core Idea: Reductio ad absurdum as the Answer**  My core idea is straightforward: The question is asking for *another name* for the fallacy ""reductio ad absurdum."" The provided context lists the fallacy itself as an option. Therefore, the answer *must* be ""reductio ad absurdum."" This is because the prompt is asking for a synonym for the fallacy, and the fallacy itself is present in the context list.  *   **Core Problem Addressed:** The question directly asks for a synonym. My response provides the synonym within the given context. *   **Key Strengths:**     *   **Directness:** The answer is immediately and unequivocally provided, fulfilling the prompt's core requirement.     *   **Accuracy:** The answer is logically sound and demonstrably correct based on the prompt's structure.     *   **Efficiency:** The response is concise and avoids unnecessary elaboration, focusing on the essential task.     *   **Focus on the Context:** The answer correctly interprets the context, which provides the answer.  **Critique of the ROT (Reversal of Thought) Idea**  The ROT idea, while comprehensive in its explanation of *reductio ad absurdum* and other fallacies, ultimately misses the core requirement of the question. Here's a breakdown of its weaknesses:  *   **Over-Elaboration:** The ROT provides extensive definitions, examples, and comparisons of the listed fallacies. While these are valuable for understanding the concepts, they are *not* necessary to answer the question. The prompt explicitly asks for a synonym. *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The ROT states that the code should return the other item in the context. This is incorrect; the code should return the item that is the synonym for the question. The ROT fails to directly answer the question which is an alternative name. *   **Missed Insight:** The ROT's solution states the correct answer, but the reasoning is not the best. It doesn't explicitly identify the answer as the synonym. *   **Inefficiency:** The ROT's approach is convoluted. It spends significant time explaining the nature of the fallacies, when all that is needed is a simple, direct answer. *   **Focus on Definition Over Identification:** The ROT prioritizes defining ""reductio ad absurdum"" over recognizing it as the answer *within the given context*. The context is the key to the problem.  **Why My Approach is Preferable**  My approach is preferable because:  1.  **Directness and Simplicity:** It delivers the correct answer immediately and efficiently. 2.  **Contextual Accuracy:** It correctly interprets the prompt's structure and context, leading to the correct answer in a straightforward manner. 3.  **Avoidance of Unnecessary Information:** It focuses solely on the task's requirements, avoiding extraneous explanations. 4.  **Logical Soundness:** The answer is logically derived from the question and the context.  In summary, the ROT's response, while demonstrating knowledge of logical fallacies, is overly complex and fails to focus on the core requirement of identifying a synonym *within the provided context*. My response provides a concise, accurate, and efficient solution that directly addresses the prompt's requirements."
4,LOT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the LOT Representative, addressing the core problem, highlighting strengths, and critically evaluating the GOT and ROT ideas.  **Core Problem and My Approach:**  The core problem is to identify the correct answer to the question: ""Another name for the fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is..."" The answer must be chosen from the provided context of logical fallacies. My approach, as the LOT Representative, is to provide a comprehensive understanding of *reductio ad absurdum* to ensure the correct selection. This involves:  1.  **Precise Definition:** Defining *reductio ad absurdum* and its function. 2.  **Differentiation:** Clearly distinguishing *reductio ad absurdum* from the other fallacies in the context. 3.  **Illustrative Examples:** Providing an original example to solidify understanding. 4.  **Logical Structure:** Explaining the internal workings of *reductio ad absurdum*. 5.  **Rephrasing and Contextualization:** Rephrasing the question and considering the historical context. 6.  **Field Applications:** Explaining how *reductio ad absurdum* is employed in different fields.  This multi-faceted approach ensures not only the correct answer but also a deep understanding of the concept.  **Strengths of My Approach:**  *   **Depth of Understanding:** Goes beyond simply identifying the correct answer by providing a thorough explanation of the fallacy. *   **Contextualization:** Places the answer within a broader understanding of logical fallacies. *   **Clarity and Precision:** The definitions and explanations are clear, concise, and avoid ambiguity. *   **Comprehensive:** Covers the historical background, logical structure, and practical applications of *reductio ad absurdum*. *   **Educational Value:** Provides a learning experience beyond just answering the question, enhancing the user's grasp of logical reasoning.  **Critical Evaluation of the GOT (Graph Of Thoughts) Idea:**  The GOT idea: ""The answer is **reductio ad absurdum**. The question is asking for another name for the fallacy itself, and the provided options are all examples of logical fallacies.""  *   **Strengths:**     *   Directly answers the question correctly.     *   Identifies the correct answer based on the prompt's instructions.  *   **Weaknesses:**     *   Lacks explanation.     *   Doesn't demonstrate an understanding of the fallacy beyond simply naming it.     *   Provides no context or differentiation between the answer and other options.     *   Offers limited educational value.     *   Very simplistic.  *   **Overlooked Aspects:**     *   The fundamental nature and function of *reductio ad absurdum*.     *   The distinction between the fallacy and its valid use as a proof technique.     *   Historical context and applications.  *   **Limitations:**     *   It's a superficial answer, providing no insight into the concept.     *   It's a black-box solution, without any explanation.  **Critical Evaluation of the ROT (Reversal Of Thought) Idea:**  The ROT idea: ""Okay, I'm ready. Based on the provided task definition, pseudocode, and case examples, here's the solution to the given problem: ...The correct answer is ""reductio ad absurdum"" because the question is asking for an alternative name.""  *   **Strengths:**     *   Correctly identifies the answer.     *   Acknowledges the input and output format.  *   **Weaknesses:**     *   Lacks depth of understanding. It simply parrots the input.     *   Provides no explanation of why ""reductio ad absurdum"" is correct.     *   The reasoning is overly simplified.     *   The ""pseudocode"" element is not really used to guide the answer. It is just repeating the prompt's definition.     *   The logical reasoning is weak, lacking analysis.  *   **Overlooked Aspects:**     *   The deeper meaning of the fallacy itself, as well as its history.     *   The distinction between this fallacy and others.     *   The broader application and implications.  *   **Limitations:**     *   It's a superficial answer, providing no insight into the concept.     *   The response is very simplistic, repeating the prompt's elements.  **Why My Approach Is Preferable:**  My approach is preferable because it provides a far richer and more informative response. It goes beyond the surface level to offer a comprehensive understanding of *reductio ad absurdum*. This makes it a more valuable learning tool and demonstrates a deeper grasp of the subject matter. While the GOT and ROT ideas provide a correct answer, they are superficial and lack the depth and educational value of my analysis. My approach addresses the core problem by providing a robust explanation and clear understanding of the concept, which is critical for true comprehension."
5,Critical_Analyst,"Here's a critical analysis of the provided responses, focusing on their weaknesses, overlooked aspects, and inconsistencies:  **Overall Assessment:**  All three responses (ROT, GOT, and LOT) correctly identify ""reductio ad absurdum"" as the answer. However, their justifications and approaches vary significantly in terms of depth, efficiency, and suitability for the task.  **Critical Analysis of the Responses:**  *   **ROT (Reversal of Thought):**      *   **Correctness:** Correct. The response accurately identifies the correct answer.     *   **Weaknesses:**         *   **Overly simplistic reasoning:** The explanation is basic and doesn't provide any deeper insight into why ""reductio ad absurdum"" is the correct choice beyond the surface level (""it's an alternative name"").         *   **Lack of Nuance:** It misses the opportunity to explain *why* ""reductio ad absurdum"" is a synonym for itself. It doesn't highlight the inherent relationship between the name and the concept.         *   **Redundancy:** Includes details like pseudocode and input-output format, which are unnecessary for answering the core question. The task is to find the synonym.     *   **Overlooked Aspects:** The response doesn't delve into the meaning of *reductio ad absurdum* itself.     *   **Inconsistencies:** The emphasis on prompt elements (pseudocode, input-output) feels disconnected from the core task. It is not necessary.     *   **Improvements:** The response could be improved by briefly explaining the meaning of *reductio ad absurdum*. For example: ""The question asks for a synonym. *Reductio ad absurdum* is the name of the fallacy, which, by definition, is an alternative name for itself.""  *   **GOT (Graph of Thoughts):**      *   **Correctness:** Correct.     *   **Weaknesses:**         *   **Very Brief Reasoning:** The explanation is extremely concise, bordering on superficial. While efficient, it doesn't offer any deeper understanding.         *   **Limited Educational Value:** It simply states the answer without providing any educational value.     *   **Overlooked Aspects:** The response could have briefly clarified why ""reductio ad absurdum"" is the answer, even at a high level.     *   **Inconsistencies:** The response correctly identifies the core task, but its brevity hinders a complete understanding.     *   **Improvements:** The GOT could provide a slightly more detailed explanation. For example, ""The question asks for another name for the fallacy. Since the option 'reductio ad absurdum' *is* the name of the fallacy, it is the correct answer.""  *   **LOT (Layer of Thoughts):**      *   **Correctness:** Correct.     *   **Weaknesses:**         *   **Overkill:** This response provides far more detail than is necessary for the given task. The in-depth explanation, while informative, is disproportionate to the simplicity of the question.         *   **Inefficiency:** The response is inefficient, as it wastes time on unnecessary details.         *   **Risk of Distraction:** The extensive explanation could potentially distract from the core task.     *   **Overlooked Aspects:** While comprehensive, it could briefly mention the relationship between the name and the concept to connect the dots.     *   **Inconsistencies:** The LOT's level of detail is not appropriate for the question.     *   **Improvements:** The LOT's response is good for understanding the concept, but it could be more concise. It is more of a lesson than an answer.  **Summary of Weaknesses and Improvements for All Responses:**  *   **Weakness:** All responses, to varying degrees, could benefit from a more nuanced explanation of *why* ""reductio ad absurdum"" is the answer. *   **Improvement:** Regardless of the approach, a brief sentence or two explaining the core meaning of *reductio ad absurdum* and its connection to its name would enhance the response. This adds value without significant additional complexity.  **Suggested Response (Improved and Optimized):**  ""Another name for the fallacy of reducing to an absurdity is *reductio ad absurdum*. The term *reductio ad absurdum* *is* the name of the fallacy itself, making it the correct synonym in this context.""  **Explanation of Improvements:**  The suggested response is concise, accurate, and directly addresses the task. It offers a slightly more insightful explanation than the existing responses, connecting the name to the concept of the fallacy. It is efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity."
