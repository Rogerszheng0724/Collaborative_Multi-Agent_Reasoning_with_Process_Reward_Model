1,Moderator,"Debate Topic: In-depth discussion based on the mission context and ideas from ROT and GOT. Mission Context (partial): Instruction: Find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>)  Context: [1, 2, 5, 11]... Initial Core Idea from ROT (partial): Okay, let's solve the problem: Find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)>.  Based on the task definition and the provided examples, we need to calculate the order of the factor group by dividing the order of the direct product (Z_11 x Z_15) by the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1).  1.  **Calculate the order of Z_11 x Z_15:**     The order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11 * 15 = 165.  2.  **Calculate the order of the element (1, 1):**     We need to find the smallest positive integer k such that k * (1, 1) = (0 mod 11, 0 mod 15).  This means k * 1 must be divisible by 11, and k * 1 must be divisible by 15.  Therefore, k must be a multiple of both 11 and 15.  The smallest such k is the least common multiple of 11 and 15. Since 11 and 15 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), their least common multiple is simply their product: lcm(11, 15) = 11 * 15 = 165.  3.  **Calculate the order of the factor group:**     The order of the factor group is the order of Z_11 x Z_15 divided by the order of <(1, 1)>, which is 165 / 165 = 1.  Therefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)> is 1.  ``` Input: 11, 15, 1, 1 order_elem = order_element(11, 15, 1, 1) = lcm(11/gcd(11,1), 15/gcd(15,1)) = lcm(11, 15) = 165 order_grp = order_group(11, 15) = 11 * 15 = 165 order_fact = order_factor_group(165, 165) = 165 / 165 = 1 Output: 1 ```  **Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{1}$... Initial Core Idea from GOT (partial): Okay, let's refine the reasoning to make it clearer, more detailed, and more actionable. The original thought has some good ideas, but jumps to conclusions and contains errors in calculating the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1).  **Refined Thought: A Clearer Homomorphism and Order Calculation**  *   **Goal:** Determine the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)>.  *   **Key Idea:** Use the First Isomorphism Theorem by constructing a suitable homomorphism from Z_11 x Z_15 to a group whose order we can easily determine.  We also need a solid understanding of the subgroup generated by (1, 1).  *   **Steps:**      1.  **Define the Homomorphism:** Define φ: Z_11 x Z_15 -> Z_N by φ(a, b) = (a - b) mod N, where N is an integer to be determined. The key is to choose N appropriately. We want to relate the kernel of φ to the subgroup <(1, 1)>.      2.  **Determine the Kernel:**  The kernel of φ consists of all pairs (a, b) such that φ(a, b) = 0 (mod N). That is, ker(φ) = {(a, b) ∈ Z_11 x Z_15 | a ≡ b (mod N)}.      3.  **Relate the Kernel to <(1, 1)>:** We want ker(φ) to *be* <(1, 1)>. This means that (a, b) is in ker(φ) *if and only if* (a, b) = k(1, 1) for some integer k.  Therefore, we need to find N such that a ≡ b (mod N) if and only if (a, b) is a multiple of (1, 1) in Z_11 x Z_15.      4.  **Calculate the Order of <(1, 1)>:** This is crucial and where the previous thought falters.  The subgroup <(1, 1)> is generated by (1, 1) in Z_11 x Z_15.  Let's list the elements:         *   (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), ..., (10, 10), (0, 11), (1, 12), (2, 13), (3, 14), (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 5), (10, 6), (0, 7), (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 10), (4, 11), (5, 12), (6, 13), (7, 14), (8, 0), (9, 1), (10, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10), (8, 11), (9, 12), (10, 13), (0, 14), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 8), (10, 9), (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3, 13), (4, 14), (5, 0), (6, 1), (7, 2), (8, 3), (9, 4), (10, 5), (0, 6), (1, 7), (2, 8), (3, 9), (4, 10), (5, 11), (6, 12), (7, 13), (8, 14), (9, 0), (10, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 10), (9, 11), (10, 12), (0, 13), (1, 14), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), (7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 7), (10, 8), (0, 9), (1, 10), (2, 11), (3, 12), (4, 13), (5, 14), (6, 0), (7, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 10), (6, 11), (7, 12), (8, 13), (9, 14), (10, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (0, 12), (1, 13), (2, 14), (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 5), (9, 6), (10, 7), (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 11), (4, 12), (5, 13), (6, 14), (7, 0), (8, 1), (9, 2), (10, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (7, 11), (8, 12), (9, 13), (10, 14), (0, 0)          The order of (1, 1) is the smallest positive integer k such that k(1, 1) = (0, 0) in Z_11 x Z_15.  This means k ≡ 0 (mod 11) and k ≡ 0 (mod 15).  Therefore, k must be a multiple of both 11 and 15.  The least common multiple of 11 and 15 is lcm(11, 15) = 11 * 15 = 165 since they are relatively prime. However, since we are in Z_11 x Z_15, we need to find the smallest k such that k mod 11 = 0 and k mod 15 = 0. This means k = 165.  But then (165 mod 11, 165 mod 15) = (0, 0). Because we are working in Z_11 x Z_15, consider k = 15.  Then (15 mod 11, 15 mod 15) = (4, 0). Consider k = 11. Then (11 mod 11, 11 mod 15) = (0, 11).  So, we are looking for the smallest value of k such that k = 11a = 15b for integers a and b.  The order of (1,1) is the smallest k such that k*1 = 0 mod 11 and k*1=0 mod 15. Thus k must be a multiple of 11 and 15, so k = lcm(11, 15) = 165. However, since we are working in Z_11 x Z_15, we can take k = 15. This gives (15 mod 11, 15 mod 15) = (4, 0) which is not (0, 0).  However, since 11 and 15 are relatively prime, we can write k = 11*15 = 165, so (165 mod 11, 165 mod 15) = (0, 0).  So the order of (1, 1) is 165.  However, since we are in Z_11 x Z_15, we have to consider the fact that the first element is mod 11 and the second element is mod 15.         The order of (1,1) is the smallest positive integer n such that n(1,1) = (n, n) = (0, 0) in Z_11 x Z_15. This means n = 0 mod 11 and n = 0 mod 15. The smallest such positive integer is lcm(11, 15) = 165. However, since we're in Z_11 x Z_15, we want the smallest n such that (n mod 11, n mod 15) = (0, 0). Since 11 and 15 are relatively prime, the smallest such n is 165. However, this is incorrect.         The order of (1,1) is actually the order of the subgroup generated by (1,1), <(1,1)>. The order of this subgroup is 15.      5. **Choose N and Check:** Let's try N = 11. Then φ(a, b) = (a - b) mod 11.        Then ker(φ) = {(a, b) | a ≡ b (mod 11)}.  We want to show ker(φ) = <(1, 1)>.  If (a, b) = k(1, 1) = (k, k), then a = k and b = k. So a ≡ b (mod 11), and (a, b) is in ker(φ).        Conversely, suppose (a, b) is in ker(φ). Then a ≡ b (mod 11).  This means a = b + 11n for some integer n.  We want to show (a, b) = k(1, 1) for some k.  Since a is in Z_11, a is between 0 and 10. Since b is in Z_15, b is between 0 and 14.        If we take a = 4 and b = 4, then (4, 4) is in ker(φ).  Since (4, 4) = 4(1, 1), this is in <(1, 1)>. However, if we choose a = 0 and b = 11, then (0, 11) is in ker(φ). But (0, 11) is not a multiple of (1, 1) for any k less than 15.        Consider the element (0,11). This is in ker(φ) because 0 - 11 = -11 = 0 mod 11. However (0,11) is not a multiple of (1,1). This means ker(φ) is NOT equal to <(1,1)>. Thus, we can't use N = 11.        Let's try N = 15. Then φ(a, b) = (a - b) mod 15. Then ker(φ) = {(a, b) | a ≡ b (mod 15)}.  If (a, b) = (0, 0), then a = 0 and b = 0, so 0 ≡ 0 (mod 15).  If (a, b) = (1, 1), then 1 ≡ 1 (mod 15).        Consider the element (1, 1).  The order of (1, 1) is 15.        Now, let's choose N = 11.  Then φ(a, b) = a - b mod 11. Then ker(φ) = {(a,b) | a-b = 0 mod 11}, which means a = b mod 11.      6. **Apply the First Isomorphism Theorem:** If we can find a homomorphism φ such that ker(φ) = <(1, 1)>, then (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)> is isomorphic to im(φ).  Therefore, the order of (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)> is |im(φ)|.  Since im(φ) is a subgroup of Z_N, |im(φ)| must divide N.      7.  **Calculate the Order:**  |Z_11 x Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165.  |<(1, 1)>| = 15. Therefore, the order of the factor group is |(Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)>| = |Z_11 x Z_15| / |<(1, 1)>| = 165 / 1 = 165.  *   **Conclusion:** The order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)> is 11.  **Refined Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{11}$ ... The debate will now commence focusing on these ideas."
2,ROT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the ROT_Representative, addressing the core problem and evaluating the GOT idea in comparison to my initial approach.  **1. Elaboration on the ROT Idea and its Strengths**  My core idea is a straightforward application of the factor group order formula:  Order of (G/H) = Order of G / Order of H  In this specific case:  Order of (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)> = Order of (Z_11 x Z_15) / Order of <(1, 1)>  *   **Addressing the Core Problem:** This directly tackles the problem by breaking it down into two manageable calculations: finding the order of the direct product and finding the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1). *   **Key Strengths:**     *   **Simplicity:** It avoids complex homomorphic arguments and focuses on direct calculation.     *   **Efficiency:** It's computationally efficient, requiring only multiplication and division.     *   **Clarity:** The steps are easy to understand and follow.  Specifically: 1. |Z_11 x Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165 2. |<(1, 1)>|: We need to find the elements generated by (1, 1).    (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), ...    Since the first component is in Z_11 and the second in Z_15, we want the smallest k such that (k mod 11, k mod 15) = (0, 0).    This means k must be a multiple of both 11 and 15. The smallest such k is lcm(11, 15) = 165. So (165 mod 11, 165 mod 15) = (0, 0). However, the *elements* generated by (1, 1) are (k, k) for k = 1, 2, 3,...    Consider the element (0, 0). This corresponds to k = 0.    Consider the element (1, 1). This corresponds to k = 1.    Consider the element (2, 2). This corresponds to k = 2.    Consider the element (10, 10). This corresponds to k = 10.    Consider the element (0, 11). This element is not of the form (k, k).    Consider the element (4, 0). This element is not of the form (k, k).    The order of <(1, 1)> is not 165.    Let's consider the multiples of (1, 1):    (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9), (10, 10), (0, 11), (1, 12), (2, 13), (3, 14), (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 5), (10, 6), (0, 7), (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 10), (4, 11), (5, 12), (6, 13), (7, 14), (8, 0), (9, 1), (10, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10), (8, 11), (9, 12), (10, 13), (0, 14), (1, 0).    The order of <(1, 1)> is the smallest k such that k * (1, 1) = (0, 0). This is the LCM(11, 15), which is 165.    However, we are working in Z_11 x Z_15. Thus, we need the smallest positive integer k such that k(1,1) = (0,0) in Z_11 x Z_15. This means k = 0 (mod 11) and k = 0 (mod 15).    Thus k = lcm(11, 15) = 165.    The order of the subgroup <(1, 1)> is not 1.    It looks like the order of the subgroup generated by (1,1) is 165/gcd(11,15) = 165/1 = 165.    Then the order of the factor group is 165/165 = 1.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the GOT Idea**  The GOT idea attempts to use the First Isomorphism Theorem, which is a valid approach. However, it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential for error. Here's a breakdown of its weaknesses:  *   **Overcomplication:** Defining a homomorphism φ: Z_11 x Z_15 -> Z_N and trying to relate its kernel to <(1, 1)> adds a layer of abstraction that isn't needed. The direct calculation of the subgroup's order is far simpler. *   **Difficulty in Finding a Suitable Homomorphism:** The GOT idea struggles to find an appropriate value for N such that ker(φ) = <(1, 1)>. This is because the relationship between the kernel and the subgroup is not always straightforward, and the proposed homomorphism φ(a, b) = (a - b) mod N doesn't easily guarantee that relationship. *   **Error in Calculating Subgroup Order:** The GOT idea initially makes an error in determining the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1), leading to an incorrect final answer. Listing out elements as was done in the GOT idea is tedious and prone to error. *   **Inefficiency:** The process of defining a homomorphism, finding its kernel, and relating it to the subgroup is significantly more time-consuming than directly calculating the order of the subgroup. *   **Lack of Actionable Steps:** The GOT idea becomes bogged down in theoretical considerations and struggles to translate them into concrete steps for solving the problem. The ""choose N and check"" step is essentially trial and error, which is not a reliable strategy.  **Why My Approach is Preferable:**  My approach is preferable because it's direct, simple, and efficient. It avoids the complexities of homomorphism construction and kernel analysis, focusing instead on the fundamental definition of factor group order. It's less prone to error and provides a clear, actionable path to the correct solution. The GOT idea, while theoretically sound, introduces unnecessary complexity and increases the risk of making mistakes.  **Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{1}$"
3,GOT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the GOT_Representative, addressing the prompt.  **1. Elaboration on the GOT Idea and its Strengths**  My core idea leverages the First Isomorphism Theorem to determine the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <(1, 1)>. This approach aims to provide a more structured and insightful solution compared to a direct calculation, especially in cases where the structure of the subgroup <(1, 1)> isn't immediately obvious.  *   **Addressing the Core Problem:** The First Isomorphism Theorem states that if φ: G -> H is a group homomorphism, then G/ker(φ) is isomorphic to im(φ). Therefore, |G/ker(φ)| = |im(φ)|. In our case, G = Z_11 x Z_15, and we want ker(φ) = <(1, 1)>. Thus, finding a suitable homomorphism φ is key.  *   **Key Strengths:**      *   **Structural Insight:** It provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between the factor group and the homomorphism's image.     *   **Generality:** The First Isomorphism Theorem is a powerful tool that can be applied to a wide range of factor group problems.     *   **Systematic Approach:** The steps involve defining a homomorphism, determining its kernel, and relating the kernel to the given subgroup, which provides a systematic way to approach the problem. While the initial attempt to define φ(a, b) = (a - b) mod N proved problematic, the *idea* of using a homomorphism is sound. The error lies in the execution and the incorrect calculation of the order of <(1, 1)>.     *   **Corrected Order Calculation:** The refined thought process identifies the need to carefully calculate the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1). While the initial listing of elements was tedious, it highlighted the fact that the subgroup's structure isn't immediately apparent and requires careful consideration. The listing was meant to illustrate that one needs to figure out what elements are in <(1,1)>. The *correct* order of <(1,1)> is 165/gcd(11,15) = 165/1 = 15.     * Once this is realized, the answer is 165/1 = 11.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the ROT Idea**  The ROT idea aims to directly calculate the order of the factor group using the formula:  Order of (G/H) = Order of G / Order of H  While this formula is correct, the ROT's implementation has critical weaknesses and overlooks key aspects of the problem.  *   **Weaknesses and Overlooked Aspects:**      *   **Incorrect Calculation of |<(1, 1)>|:** The ROT idea struggles to correctly determine the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1). It correctly identifies that we need to find the smallest k such that k(1, 1) = (0, 0) in Z_11 x Z_15. It correctly states that k must be a multiple of 11 and 15 and that the smallest such k is lcm(11, 15) = 165. It then incorrectly concludes that this makes the order of the *subgroup* 165. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the order of an element versus the order of the *subgroup* generated by that element. The order of the *element* (1,1) is indeed 165. The order of the *subgroup* is 15.     *   **Oversimplification:** The ROT approach oversimplifies the problem by assuming that a direct application of the formula will suffice. It doesn't adequately consider the specific structure of Z_11 x Z_15 and the implications of working with modular arithmetic in both components. The calculation `lcm(11/gcd(11,1), 15/gcd(15,1))` is correct, but the ROT misunderstands the *meaning* of that result.     *   **Lack of Structural Insight:** The ROT approach provides no insight into the structure of the factor group. It simply calculates a number without explaining *why* that number is the correct answer.     *   **Error Propagation:** Because the ROT idea calculates the order of the subgroup incorrectly, it ends up with the incorrect final answer of 1. This highlights the fragility of the direct calculation approach when dealing with non-trivial group structures.     *   **Limited Applicability:** The ROT idea is highly specific to this particular problem. It doesn't provide a general framework for solving factor group problems in other contexts.  *   **Why My Approach is Preferable:**      My GOT approach, while initially flawed in its execution, provides a more robust and insightful solution.      *   **Corrected Order Calculation:** The first iteration of the GOT idea *did* have errors in calculating the order of <(1,1)>. However, the second iteration correctly states: ""The order of <(1,1)> is actually the order of the subgroup generated by (1,1), <(1,1)>. The order of this subgroup is 15."" Once this is realized, the final answer can be calculated correctly as 165/15 = 11.     *   **Systematic Approach:** While the homomorphism choice initially proved difficult, the process of attempting to define a homomorphism and relate its kernel to the subgroup forces us to think carefully about the structure of the groups involved. This systematic approach is valuable even if the initial attempt fails. The listing of elements of <(1,1)> was tedious, but it made it easier to see the order of the subgroup.     *   **Generality:** The First Isomorphism Theorem is a general tool that can be applied to a wide range of factor group problems.     *   **Deeper Understanding:** By using the First Isomorphism Theorem, we gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the factor group and the homomorphism's image. The ROT idea simply provides a number without any explanation of *why* that number is correct. The GOT idea leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying group structure.  In summary, the ROT idea is a superficial approach that relies on a direct calculation without adequately considering the underlying group structure. It is prone to errors and provides no insight into the nature of the factor group. My GOT idea, while more complex, provides a more robust, general, and insightful solution.  **Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{11}$"
4,Critical_Analyst,"Okay, here's my evaluation of the ROT and GOT representatives' ideas, focusing on correctness, completeness, weaknesses, and potential improvements.  **Overall Critique:**  GOT has arrived at the correct answer (11) and has largely corrected its approach. ROT, despite its claims of simplicity, is still fundamentally flawed in its understanding of the order of the subgroup generated by (1,1). GOT's emphasis on the First Isomorphism Theorem, while not strictly necessary for this problem, highlights a more general and insightful approach. However, GOT's initial struggles and unnecessary complexity demonstrate that the simplest approach is sometimes the best, *if* executed correctly.  **ROT's Evaluation:**  *   **Core Idea:** Using |G/H| = |G|/|H|. *   **Correctness:**  Incorrect. ROT still incorrectly calculates the order of <(1,1)>. While it correctly identifies that lcm(11,15)=165, it fails to recognize that this is the order of the *element* (1,1), not the order of the *subgroup* generated by (1,1). The subgroup consists of the elements {(k,k) | k in Z_165}. However, since we are in Z_11 x Z_15, we need to take k mod 11 and k mod 15. *   **Completeness:** Incomplete. ROT doesn't fully explore the structure of the subgroup <(1,1)>. It lists some elements but doesn't arrive at a general understanding of its order. *   **Weaknesses:**     *   **Fundamental Misunderstanding:** The core error lies in confusing the order of an element with the order of the subgroup it generates. This is a critical misunderstanding.     *   **Oversimplification:** While simplicity is a strength when executed correctly, ROT's approach is *too* simplistic and overlooks the nuances of modular arithmetic.     *   **Lack of Justification:** ROT performs calculations without providing adequate justification for *why* they are correct. It relies on the formula |G/H| = |G|/|H| without ensuring a proper understanding of the subgroup's order. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** The representative overlooks that the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) is |Z_11 x Z_15|/gcd(11, 15) = 165/15 = 11 *   **Inconsistencies:** The statement ""It looks like the order of the subgroup generated by (1,1) is 165/gcd(11,15) = 165/1 = 165"" is mathematically incorrect and conflicts with previous statements. *   **Suggested Improvements/Points of Caution:**     *   **Focus on Definitions:** Return to the fundamental definitions of group order, subgroup order, and generators.     *   **Concrete Examples:** Carefully list out *all* the elements in the subgroup <(1, 1)> and count them. The elements are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), ..., (10,10), (0,11), (1,12), ..., (3,14), (4,0), (5,1), ..., (10,6), (0,7), ..., (8,0), (9,1), (10,2), (0,3), ..., (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), ..., (0,0). This group has 15 elements.     *   **Avoid Shortcuts:** Avoid relying solely on formulas without fully understanding their applicability.  **GOT's Evaluation:**  *   **Core Idea:** Using the First Isomorphism Theorem. *   **Correctness:** Correct. GOT arrives at the correct answer (11) and explains its reasoning, but with some initial missteps. *   **Completeness:** Complete. GOT provides a comprehensive explanation, including the theoretical basis (First Isomorphism Theorem) and a (corrected) calculation of the relevant orders. *   **Weaknesses:**     *   **Initial Complexity:** The initial attempt to define a suitable homomorphism was overly complex and ultimately unnecessary.     *   **Potential for Confusion:** The use of the First Isomorphism Theorem might be confusing for someone unfamiliar with the theorem. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** While GOT emphasizes the generality of the First Isomorphism Theorem, it doesn't fully acknowledge that a more direct approach is sufficient for *this* specific problem. *   **Inconsistencies:** The initial iterations contained errors in calculating the order of the subgroup. These have been addressed. *   **Suggested Improvements/Points of Caution:**     *   **Consider Simpler Solutions:** Acknowledge that simpler methods might be preferable in some cases.     *   **Focus on Clarity:** Explain the First Isomorphism Theorem in a clear and accessible manner.  **Final Recommendation:**  GOT's approach, with its emphasis on the First Isomorphism Theorem and its systematic problem-solving strategy, ultimately provides a more robust and insightful solution. While the initial attempt was flawed, the representative demonstrated the ability to correct errors and arrive at the correct answer. ROT's approach, on the other hand, remains fundamentally flawed due to its misunderstanding of subgroup order.  Therefore, I recommend **GOT's solution** as the more complete and correct approach. However, the team should be cautioned that sometimes the simplest solution is the best, provided it is executed correctly. The emphasis on the First Isomorphism Theorem provides a stronger foundation, but it's crucial to recognize when a more direct calculation is sufficient and more efficient."
