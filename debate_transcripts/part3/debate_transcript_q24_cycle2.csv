1,Moderator,"Debate Topic: In-depth discussion based on the mission context and ideas from ROT and LOT. Mission Context (partial): Instruction: What is Kant's 'categorical imperative?  Context: The following are multiple choice options:[You must not consciously harm another person., You must always act in the best interests of the community., You must treat human beings as means rather than ends., You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.]... Initial Core Idea from ROT (partial): Okay, let's analyze the options and determine which best represents Kant's categorical imperative.  *   **""You must not consciously harm another person.""** This option touches upon the idea of moral duty and avoiding harm, which aligns with the general spirit of Kantian ethics. However, it's not a direct formulation of the categorical imperative. It's more of a specific moral rule that *could* be derived from the categorical imperative, but it doesn't capture the core principle.  *   **""You must always act in the best interests of the community.""** This option leans towards utilitarianism or consequentialism, focusing on the overall good of the community. Kantian ethics, in contrast, emphasizes duty and acting according to universalizable principles, regardless of the consequences. This option is not a good fit.  *   **""You must treat human beings as means rather than ends.""** This option is the *opposite* of a key formulation of the categorical imperative, specifically the Formula of Humanity. Kant argued that we should treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means to our own ends. This option is incorrect.  *   **""You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.""** This option is the closest to the Formula of Universal Law. It suggests considering whether your actions could be universalized, a central tenet of Kant's ethics. While not a perfect paraphrase, it captures the essence of acting according to principles that could be applied universally.  Therefore, the best option is:  **You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.**... Initial Detailed Plan from LOT (partial): Aggregated result from layer 143 (Concept: 'Generate and present the answer based on the plan...') using strategy 'all_content_ranked': - (Criterion: 'Criterion A (Level 1): Re-evaluate the refined version of option 4 (""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."") in terms of its accessibility to a general audience. Simplify the language further while retaining the core meaning of universalizability', Level: 1):   Okay, the goal is to make the phrasing of Option 4 (""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."") more accessible to a general audience, while still capturing the essence of the Formula of Universal Law.  Here's a revised version:  ""Act only according to principles that you would want everyone to follow.""  This simplifies the language by:  *   Replacing ""maxim"" with ""principles,"" which is more easily understood. *   Rephrasing ""whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"" with ""that you would want everyone to follow."" This captures the core idea of universalizability in a more direct and less technical way.  This revised version maintains the core meaning of the Formula of Universal Law while being more understandable to a broader audience. It emphasizes the idea that our actions should be guided by principles that we believe should apply to everyone.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion B (Level 1): Analyze the relationship between the Formula of Universal Law and the Formula of Humanity. Does one formulation logically imply the other? How does this relationship affect the choice of the best option?', Level: 1):   The Formula of Universal Law (FUL) essentially states: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. The Formula of Humanity (FH) states: Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.  While distinct, they are related. The FUL tests the logical consistency of a maxim when universalized. The FH focuses on the moral imperative to respect the intrinsic worth of rational beings. One doesn't *strictly* imply the other in a purely logical sense, but they are mutually reinforcing within Kant's system. An action that treats someone merely as a means is unlikely to be universalizable without contradiction (e.g., a universal law of lying promises would undermine the very institution of promising). Conversely, a maxim that cannot be universalized is likely to involve treating someone as a mere means (e.g., stealing, which relies on the victim not also stealing from you).  The relationship matters because it helps clarify the options. Options that focus on universalizability or respecting humanity are more closely aligned with Kant's categorical imperative than options focusing on community interests or simply avoiding harm. The best option should reflect either the universality or the humanity aspect.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion C (Level 2): Consider scenarios where seemingly harmless actions, when universalized, could lead to negative consequences (e.g., always being late). How does this inform the selection of the best option?', Level: 1):   Okay, let's consider scenarios where seemingly harmless actions, when universalized, lead to negative consequences. This exercise is designed to help us understand the *Formula of Universal Law*, which is a key formulation of Kant's categorical imperative. This formula essentially states that you should only act according to a maxim that you could will to become a universal law.  *   **Scenario: Always Being Late.** If everyone were always late, appointments would become meaningless, coordination would break down, and trust would erode. A society built on constant lateness would be inefficient and ultimately self-defeating.  *   **Scenario: Lying to Get Out of Trouble.** If everyone lied to get out of trouble, no one would believe anyone, and communication would be impossible. The very act of lying relies on the assumption that others generally tell the truth.  *   **Scenario: Breaking Promises Whenever Convenient.** If everyone broke promises whenever it was convenient, promises would become worthless. No one would enter into agreements, and social cooperation would collapse.  Now, let's revisit the provided options in light of this understanding:  *   **""You must not consciously harm another person.""** While generally a good principle, it doesn't fully capture the *Universal Law* aspect. Kant isn't simply about avoiding harm; it's about the *reason* behind your actions and whether that reason could be universalized. A maxim could be harmful even without conscious intent, or it could be beneficial in a particular case but harmful if universalized.  *   **""You must always act in the best interests of the community.""** This is closer to utilitarianism than Kantian ethics. Kant emphasizes individual duty and the rationality of the maxim, not necessarily the overall consequences for the community. While the community's well-being might be a *result* of following the categorical imperative, it's not the *basis* for it.  *   **""You must treat human beings as means rather than ends.""** This is the *opposite* of Kant's *Formula of Humanity*, which states that you should always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end. This option is incorrect.  *   **""You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.""** This is the closest option to the *Formula of Universal Law*. It captures the idea that you should only act on principles that you could rationally will to become universal laws. It forces you to consider whether your actions are based on principles that could be consistently applied to all rational beings. The scenarios above illustrate why this is important. If you value being late, you must consider if a world where everyone is late is desirable or even possible.  Therefore, considering the potential negative consequences of universalizing certain actions, the option that best represents Kant's categorical imperative is: **""You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.""** It compels us to consider the universalizability of our maxims, which is central to Kant's ethical framework.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion D (Level 2): Investigate the concept of ""maxims"" in Kantian ethics. Provide concrete examples of maxims and how they are tested using the Formula of Universal Law', Level: 1):   Okay, here's an elaboration on the concept of ""maxims"" in Kantian ethics, with examples, and how they are tested using the Formula of Universal Law. This will help in selecting the best multiple-choice option regarding the categorical imperative.  **Maxims in Kantian Ethics**  A maxim, in Kantian ethics, is a subjective principle of action. It's the personal rule or intention behind a particular action. It answers the question: ""What am I doing, and why am I doing it?""  Crucially, it's *not* the action itself, but the *reason* for the action.  **Components of a Maxim:**  A well-formed maxim typically includes:  *   **The Action:** What you intend to do. *   **The Circumstance:** The situation in which you will perform the action. *   **The End/Purpose:** The reason or goal you hope to achieve by performing the action.  **Examples of Maxims:**  1.  **""When I am short on money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, even though I know I won't be able to, in order to get the money I need.""**  (Action: Borrowing money and promising to repay. Circumstance: Being short on money. End: Getting the money needed.)  2.  **""When I am bored, I will spread rumors about others, in order to entertain myself.""** (Action: Spreading rumors. Circumstance: Being bored. End: Entertaining oneself.)  3.  **""When someone asks me for help, and it is within my power to help them without significant inconvenience to myself, I will help them, in order to promote general well-being.""** (Action: Helping someone. Circumstance: Someone needs help, and I can provide it without significant inconvenience. End: Promoting general well-being.)  4.  **""When I feel like it, I will study diligently, in order to get good grades.""** (Action: Studying diligently. Circumstance: Feeling like it. End: Getting good grades.)  **Testing Maxims with the Formula of Universal Law:**  The Formula of Universal Law (FUL) is one formulation of Kant's categorical imperative. It states: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.""  To test a maxim using the FUL, you must perform the following thought experiment:  1.  **Universalize the Maxim:** Imagine that everyone in the world adopted your maxim and acted according to it.  This transforms your subjective principle into an objective law.  2.  **Consider the Consequences:**  Think about what the world would be like if everyone followed this universalized maxim.  3.  **Identify Contradictions:**  Determine if the universalized maxim leads to either of two types of contradictions:      *   **Contradiction in Conception:** The very act prescribed by the maxim becomes impossible or self-defeating when universalized.  The action undermines the conditions necessary for its own performance.      *   **Contradiction in Will:**  While the universalized maxim might be conceivable, it's impossible to *will* it as a universal law. This usually involves undermining something that is necessarily willed by every rational being (e.g., having others help you when you need it).  **Applying the FUL to the Examples:**  1.  **Borrowing with No Intention to Repay:** If *everyone* borrowed money with no intention to repay, the institution of promising would be destroyed. No one would believe promises, and therefore no one would lend money. The very act of borrowing and promising becomes impossible.  This leads to a **contradiction in conception**.  2.  **Spreading Rumors for Entertainment:** If everyone spread rumors when bored, trust and social cohesion would erode. While conceivable, it's likely to lead to a breakdown in communication and cooperation. Furthermore, if everyone is spreading rumors, the entertainment value diminishes, as everyone would be equally suspect. Depending on the severity, this *could* potentially lead to a contradiction in conception (if trust collapses entirely). It might also lead to a **contradiction in will**, as one would likely will that others not spread rumors about them.  3.  **Helping Others When Convenient:** Universalizing this maxim is permissible. A world where people help each other when it's convenient is perfectly conceivable and arguably desirable. There is no contradiction in conception or will.  4.  **Studying Diligently When I Feel Like It:** This maxim is also permissible. While a world where everyone only studies when they feel like it might not be ideal, it's conceivable and doesn't necessarily lead to a contradiction. However, if ""feeling like it"" is rare, and the consequence is widespread ignorance, it *could* be argued that it contradicts a will to have knowledge and capability in the world.  **Relevance to the Multiple-Choice Options:**  Understanding maxims and the Formula of Universal Law helps us see that Kant's ethics is about more than just avoiding harm or acting in the community's interest. It's about acting according to principles that *could* be universal laws without contradiction. This directly relates to the multiple-choice options, making us better equipped to choose the most accurate one.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion E (Level 3): Research criticisms of the Formula of Universal Law, such as the triviality objection (that almost any action can be universalized with sufficient specificity). How do these criticisms influence the interpretation of option 4?', Level: 1):   The triviality objection to the Formula of Universal Law argues that almost any immoral action can be justified if described with sufficient specificity. For example, ""I will lie when it benefits me and the victim is someone I dislike on a Tuesday afternoon"" could be universalized, albeit with a highly specific condition.  This criticism highlights the importance of carefully considering the *intent* and *scope* of the maxim being universalized. It suggests that Kant's imperative isn't simply about finding a *logically* consistent universal law, but about identifying a *morally* justifiable one. The specificity objection forces us to ask: what *principle* is really being universalized?  Option 4, ""You must act according as if your values apply to everyone,"" touches on the *idea* of universalizability, but it's weaker than the Formula of Universal Law. The phrase ""your values"" is problematic. A person's values could be selfish or biased. The Formula of Universal Law demands a *rational* principle, not just a personally held value, be universalized. The criticism about triviality reinforces this point: simply universalizing a value, even if you *think* it's a value, is not enough. It must be a principle that could rationally be willed as a universal law without contradiction. So, while option 4 gestured at the right direction, it is still not the best answer.  - (Criterion: 'Criterion F (Level 3): Explore the difference between hypothetical and categorical imperatives. How does understanding this distinction clarify the meaning and importance of the categorical imperative in Kant's ethical system?', Level: 1):   The key difference between hypothetical and categorical imperatives is that hypothetical imperatives are conditional (""If you want X, do Y""), driven by desires or goals. Categorical imperatives, on the other hand, are unconditional and apply to everyone regardless of their personal desires. Kant believed morality must be based on categorical imperatives, not hypothetical ones, because morality should be universal and binding on all rational beings. Understanding this distinction highlights that the categorical imperative is not about achieving specific outcomes or fulfilling individual desires. It's about acting according to principles that are inherently good and universally applicable. This understanding clarifies why options related to personal desires or specific outcomes are incorrect. The option closest to a categorical imperative formulation focuses on the universalizability of one's actions, reflecting the unconditional nature of moral duty according to Kant.  ... The debate will now commence focusing on these ideas."
2,ROT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the ROT Representative, addressing the core problem and critically evaluating the LOT idea.  **1. Elaboration on the ROT Idea and its Strengths**  My core idea is to analyze each multiple-choice option in the context of Kant's Categorical Imperative and determine which best represents it. This approach directly addresses the core problem: identifying the most accurate representation of Kant's complex philosophical concept within a limited set of choices.  Here's how my idea addresses the problem and its strengths:  *   **Direct Comparison:** It forces a direct comparison of each option against the fundamental principles of Kantian ethics (Universalizability, Humanity as an End). This avoids getting bogged down in tangential discussions and keeps the focus on the core instruction. *   **Process of Elimination:** By systematically analyzing each option and highlighting its flaws or misalignments with Kantian principles, it uses a process of elimination to arrive at the most plausible answer. This is particularly effective in a multiple-choice scenario. *   **Clear Justification:** The rationale for selecting the ""best"" option is clearly articulated, referencing specific aspects of Kant's philosophy. This makes the reasoning transparent and easy to follow. *   **Practical Application:** It connects the abstract concepts of Kantian ethics to concrete, understandable interpretations of the multiple-choice options. *   **Highlights Nuances:** It acknowledges that the ""best"" option might not be a perfect paraphrase of the Categorical Imperative but is the closest approximation given the available choices.  The key strength of my approach is its practicality and direct relevance to the multiple-choice format. It avoids getting lost in theoretical complexities and focuses on identifying the option that *best* reflects Kant's ideas within the given constraints.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the LOT Idea**  The LOT idea, as presented, involves a multi-faceted approach, which is commendable. However, I see several weaknesses and overlooked aspects that make my ROT approach preferable in this specific context:  *   **Over-Elaboration and Reduced Focus:** The LOT idea dives deeply into explaining maxims, hypothetical vs. categorical imperatives, and even criticisms of the Formula of Universal Law. While this information is valuable for a thorough understanding of Kant, it risks diluting the focus on the *specific question* being asked: Which multiple-choice option *best* represents the categorical imperative? The sheer volume of information could overwhelm someone simply seeking the correct answer within the given context. My ROT approach is more streamlined and targeted. *   **Risk of ""Analysis Paralysis"":** The LOT approach, particularly with its multi-level criteria, could lead to ""analysis paralysis."" It might prompt the user to overthink the nuances of each option and get lost in the complexities of Kantian scholarship, rather than simply selecting the *most* accurate answer from the choices provided. *   **Problematic Simplification:** While Criterion A aims to simplify option 4, the revised version (""Act only according to principles that you would want everyone to follow."") introduces potential ambiguity. What constitutes a ""principle that you would want everyone to follow"" is highly subjective and open to interpretation, potentially undermining the universality that Kant sought. *   **Missed Opportunity to Address ""Values"" Directly:** The LOT analysis does eventually critique the use of ""values"" in the chosen option, but it's somewhat buried in the Criterion E discussion. A more direct and upfront critique of the term ""values"" would have been beneficial, highlighting how it deviates from the more rigorous ""rational principle"" that Kant intended. My ROT approach, while imperfect, directly acknowledges this weakness. *   **Overlooked the Formula of Humanity in Initial Analysis:** The LOT approach focuses heavily on the Formula of Universal Law but gives less emphasis to the Formula of Humanity in its initial analysis of the options. My ROT approach correctly identifies that option 3 is the *opposite* of the Formula of Humanity, making it clearly incorrect. This direct comparison is valuable.  **Why my ROT Approach is Preferable:**  My ROT approach is preferable because it is:  *   **More Direct and Efficient:** It directly addresses the core problem without unnecessary detours into tangential topics. *   **More Focused on the Question:** It keeps the focus squarely on evaluating the multiple-choice options in light of Kant's philosophy. *   **More Practical for a Multiple-Choice Scenario:** It provides a clear and concise rationale for selecting the best option, using a process of elimination and direct comparison. *   **Less Prone to Overthinking:** It avoids overwhelming the user with excessive information and encourages a pragmatic approach to selecting the most accurate answer.  In summary, while the LOT approach offers a more comprehensive exploration of Kantian ethics, my ROT approach provides a more practical and efficient solution to the specific task of identifying the best representation of the Categorical Imperative within the given multiple-choice options. It is targeted, focused, and avoids getting lost in the complexities of Kantian scholarship. My ROT approach prioritizes clarity and direct relevance, making it better suited to the specific constraints of the instruction."
3,LOT_Representative,"Okay, here's my response as the LOT Representative, addressing the core problem, highlighting the strengths and feasibility of my plan, and critically evaluating the ROT idea.  **1. Elaboration on the LOT Idea and its Strengths**  My core idea, as represented by the aggregated result from layer 143, is to systematically analyze the multiple-choice options through a series of layered criteria, moving from accessibility and core concept alignment to nuanced considerations of maxims, criticisms, and related concepts like hypothetical vs. categorical imperatives. This approach directly addresses the core problem of identifying the best representation of Kant's categorical imperative by:  *   **Progressive Refinement:** The criteria build upon each other, starting with making the language accessible (Criterion A) and ensuring alignment with the Formula of Universal Law and Humanity (Criterion B), then delving into practical scenarios (Criterion C), the concept of maxims (Criterion D), criticisms (Criterion E), and related concepts (Criterion F). This progressive refinement ensures a thorough understanding and evaluation. *   **Comprehensive Understanding:** It doesn't just focus on finding the ""right"" answer; it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the categorical imperative and its various facets. This is crucial for anyone trying to grasp Kant's philosophy beyond a superficial level. *   **Addressing Nuances:** It explicitly addresses the weaknesses of the ""best"" option (Option 4) by acknowledging the problematic nature of the term ""values"" and considering criticisms like the triviality objection. This demonstrates a deeper understanding than simply selecting an answer. *   **Practical Application:** It uses concrete examples and scenarios (e.g., being late, lying) to illustrate the implications of universalizing maxims, making the abstract concepts more tangible. *   **Multi-faceted Approach:** It considers both the Formula of Universal Law and the Formula of Humanity, recognizing that both are key formulations of the categorical imperative.  **Key Strengths and Feasibility:**  *   **Thoroughness:** The layered approach ensures a thorough examination of all relevant aspects of Kant's categorical imperative. *   **Educational Value:** It provides a learning experience, not just an answer. The detailed explanations and examples enhance understanding. *   **Critical Thinking:** It encourages critical thinking by addressing criticisms and nuances of the concepts. *   **Feasibility:** While comprehensive, each criterion can be addressed individually, making the overall plan manageable. The criteria are designed to provide a structured framework for analyzing the options.  **2. Critical Evaluation of the ROT Idea**  The ROT idea, as presented, has the merit of being direct and efficient. However, it suffers from several weaknesses and overlooks crucial aspects compared to my LOT plan:  *   **Superficial Analysis:** The ROT idea provides a relatively superficial analysis of each option. While it correctly identifies the flaws in Options 2 and 3, its reasoning lacks depth. For instance, it dismisses Option 1 (""You must not consciously harm another person"") as ""not a direct formulation"" without exploring *why* it falls short of capturing the essence of the categorical imperative. My LOT plan, on the other hand, delves into why avoiding harm alone is insufficient. *   **Lack of Nuance:** The ROT idea fails to fully grapple with the nuances of the categorical imperative. It acknowledges that Option 4 is ""not a perfect paraphrase"" but doesn't adequately explain *why* it's imperfect or what specific limitations it has. My LOT plan directly addresses the problematic use of the term ""values"" and considers criticisms of the Formula of Universal Law, demonstrating a more nuanced understanding. *   **Over-reliance on Process of Elimination:** The ROT idea relies heavily on a process of elimination, which can be risky. If the user doesn't fully understand the flaws in the incorrect options, they might choose the ""least bad"" option without truly understanding why it's the best. *   **Limited Educational Value:** The ROT idea primarily focuses on finding the ""right"" answer, with limited emphasis on providing a deeper understanding of Kantian ethics. It doesn't explore related concepts or encourage critical thinking. *   **Misses the Interconnectedness:** ROT treats each option in isolation. LOT emphasizes the relationship between the Formula of Universal Law and the Formula of Humanity, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding.  **3. Why the LOT Approach is Preferable**  My LOT approach is preferable because it provides a more comprehensive, nuanced, and educational analysis of the multiple-choice options. It goes beyond simply identifying the ""best"" answer and aims to foster a deeper understanding of Kant's categorical imperative. While the ROT approach is more direct and efficient, it sacrifices depth and nuance for the sake of brevity.  *   **Addressing the ""Values"" Problem:** The ROT plan does not adequately critique the use of ""values"" in option 4, while LOT specifically calls out the problem with the phrase. This is a critical distinction. *   **Acknowledging and Addressing Criticisms:** The ROT plan does not address the criticisms of the Formula of Universal Law, while LOT explicitly addresses it. *   **Depth of Understanding:** The LOT approach, by exploring maxims, hypothetical/categorical imperatives, and criticisms, provides a significantly deeper understanding of Kantian ethics.  While the ROT approach might be sufficient for someone who simply wants the answer, the LOT approach is more valuable for someone who wants to truly understand Kant's categorical imperative and its implications. The LOT plan's progressive refinement and detailed explanations provide a richer and more meaningful learning experience. The ROT approach's efficiency comes at the cost of a superficial understanding. Therefore, the LOT approach is preferable for achieving a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topic."
4,Critical_Analyst,"Okay, here's a critical analysis of the ROT and LOT approaches, followed by a synthesized accurate answer.  **Critical Analysis of ROT:**  *   **Strengths:** ROT's approach is direct, efficient, and practical for a multiple-choice scenario. It provides a clear justification for its choice and effectively eliminates incorrect options by directly comparing them to Kantian principles. *   **Weaknesses:** ROT's analysis is somewhat superficial. It doesn't delve deeply into *why* certain options are incorrect beyond a basic level. It also glosses over the problematic use of ""values"" in the chosen option. The reliance on process of elimination, while effective, can be risky if the underlying reasoning isn't sound. It also lacks the educational depth that a more comprehensive approach could provide. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** ROT doesn't fully explore the interconnectedness of the Formula of Universal Law and the Formula of Humanity. It also doesn't address potential criticisms of the Formula of Universal Law, which would further refine the analysis. *   **Improvements:** ROT could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the limitations of Option 4, specifically addressing the subjectivity inherent in the term ""values"" and the potential for trivialization of the universalization process. *   **Correctness/Completeness:** ROT arrives at the correct answer but lacks complete justification and depth of understanding.  **Critical Analysis of LOT:**  *   **Strengths:** LOT's approach is comprehensive, nuanced, and educational. It provides a layered analysis that progressively refines the understanding of the categorical imperative. It addresses criticisms and nuances and considers the relationship between different formulations of the categorical imperative. The inclusion of concrete examples enhances understanding. *   **Weaknesses:** LOT's approach risks over-elaboration and analysis paralysis. The sheer volume of information could overwhelm someone simply seeking the correct answer. While Criterion A aims to simplify Option 4, the revised version introduces potential ambiguity by using more subjective wording. *   **Overlooked Aspects:** While comprehensive, LOT's initial simplification of Option 4 in Criterion A could be misleading. *   **Improvements:** LOT should more clearly articulate the limitations of Option 4 as the *best available choice*, rather than implying it's a perfect representation of the categorical imperative. In initial simplification, it should stay closer to the original intention. *   **Correctness/Completeness:** LOT provides a correct answer and a more complete understanding of the concepts, but it can be overwhelming and less directly focused on the multiple-choice nature of the task.  **Balanced Overall Critique:**  Both ROT and LOT have their strengths and weaknesses. ROT is efficient and practical, while LOT is thorough and educational. ROT is better suited for someone who simply wants the answer, while LOT is more valuable for someone who wants to truly understand Kant's categorical imperative. However, LOT risks losing sight of the specific task due to its comprehensive nature. Both correctly identify Option 4 as the ""best"" answer, but LOT's justification is more nuanced and addresses the limitations of that choice more effectively.  ### Synthesized Accurate Answer: You must act according as if your values apply to everyone."
