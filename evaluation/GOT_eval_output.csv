**Tesla's Acquisition of the NUMMI Factory: A History Rooted in Collaboration and Transformation**

Tesla's acquisition of the Fremont factory, now known as Tesla Factory, has a significant history tied to a previous collaboration between Toyota and General Motors (GM).  This history and Tesla's eventual acquisition can be understood by examining the following:

1.  **The NUMMI Legacy:** The factory began its life as the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), a joint venture between Toyota and GM established in 1984. This partnership was groundbreaking at the time, allowing GM to learn Toyota's lean manufacturing techniques and Toyota to gain a foothold in the American market. NUMMI produced various models for both companies, including the Toyota Corolla and the Pontiac Vibe. This factory was known for its innovative production methods and harmonious labor relations.  NUMMI closed in 2010 following GM's bankruptcy and Toyota's subsequent withdrawal.

2.  **Tesla and Toyota's Electric Vehicle Partnership:** Before Tesla acquired the factory, Tesla and Toyota entered into a partnership focused on electric vehicle development. This partnership was announced in **May 2010**. Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla, and the two companies agreed to collaborate on the development of electric vehicles, parts, and production system support.

3.  **Tesla's Acquisition of the Fremont Factory:**  Tesla purchased the NUMMI factory from Toyota in **2010**. The acquisition was crucial for Tesla, providing the company with a large-scale manufacturing facility to produce its electric vehicles. The Fremont factory offered significant advantages in terms of size, infrastructure, and location.

4.  **Official Tesla Statements:** Reviewing Tesla's official press releases and SEC filings from 2010 would provide specific details about the acquisition, including the purchase price, terms of the agreement, and Tesla's plans for the facility. This would include things like:

    *   **SEC Filings:** Look for 8-K filings (current reports) around the acquisition date, as these would detail material events like a major asset purchase. Also, review their annual 10-K reports for mentions of the factory and its impact on operations.
    *   **Press Releases:** Search the Tesla investor relations website for press releases announcing the acquisition and subsequent factory upgrades.

In summary, Tesla's acquisition of the Fremont factory was strategically important for its growth. It provided a crucial manufacturing base and was preceded by a partnership with Toyota, the former co-owner of the factory, demonstrating a complex interplay of collaboration and independent growth in the automotive industry. Reviewing Tesla's official statements from the period would provide the most accurate and detailed account of the acquisition.",0.0005,0.0223,0.0136,0.0091,0.0136,0.7407,0.8421,0.7881
