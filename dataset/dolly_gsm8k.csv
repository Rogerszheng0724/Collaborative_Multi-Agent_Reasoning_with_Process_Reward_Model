What s epigenomics?,,"Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome. The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays.",open_qa

I know that I will have to ensure my tortoise is well fed, kept at the right temperature, given opportunities to bask under a heated lamp or in the sunshine if warm enough. I am very willing to give the time and commitment necessary to look after my tortoise. The tortoise will be my sole responsibility and I feel mature enough to commit to its care and happiness.

As you know, I suffer from anxiety and school makes me particularly worried sometimes. It has been shown through numerous studies that pets reduce anxiety and stress in humans. I feel sure that having a tortoise will be a fantastic distraction from my worries and bring me great enjoyment. Contrary to popular belief, tortoises love having their shells stroked and their chins tickled and I think it would be very relaxing for me to pet a tortoise when I get home from school.

Tortoises are very self-sufficient. Provided they are given a warm place to bask, access to fresh water and plenty of fresh food such as dandelions, kale, lettuce and other leafy vegetables, they are very happy to be left to their own devices. As we live in the UK where temperatures can be cool, we would need to purchase a tortoise table with good substrate, a basking lamp and some hides where the tortoise can tuck itself away. We have lots of space for this in our kitchen. When it is warm, the tortoise can go into our garden in an enclosure. A tortoise table and lamp will cost about ¬£200 but this is just an initial outlay. Thereafter, keeping a tortoise is very cheap. In fact, you can pick most of their food for free by foraging which I am happy to do when we go for families walk.

Contrary to popular belief, tortoises can be very friendly. As I have mentioned above, they love being stroked but did you also know that they can recognise their owners and some can even respond to their names? In fact, a study showed that tortoises can recognise their previous owners that they haven?ôt seen in years so they are both friendly and very intelligent.
You might be worried about hibernating a tortoise but I have done lots of research on this and now know exactly what to do. If we buy a tortoise, it will need to hibernate for a maximum of three months from the end of September. We will need to hibernate our tortoise in a well-insulated box. The temperature mustn?ôt go above or below 5 degrees celsius and our garage would be the perfect place for it. We have a temperature gauge in there so I can keep an eye on the heat levels. 

Finally, I have looked into the cost of buying a tortoise. I would suggest we buy a tortoise which is a couple of years??old as they require less care. We can buy a preloved tortoise which has been microchipped for about ¬£100. And when we go on holiday, I have found a Tortoise Hotel which is run by a vet and costs just ¬£60 for a 10 day stay.

I think you will agree that I have conducted very thorough research into looking after a tortoise and I hope you will agree that I am now mature enough to look after a pet. I truly believe that a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility and will have a positive calming effect on my mood. Indeed, I think the whole family will enjoy having a tortoise. They are friendly, loving, interesting and intelligent animals and we will all benefit from having one.

I would be grateful if you would give my request full consideration.

Lots of Love,

"If  you found yourself  washed  up on  a  deserted tropical island with no hope for immediate rescue, what  would  you do?",,"The immediate first step is to ensure you are not materially injured.  Assuming your only manifestation of harm is a psychological roller coaster of fear, anger and hopelessness,  your best course of action is to attend to your basic needs first.  

Locate a protected space away from the wind but not too deep into the surrounding jungle, built a fire pit and gather enough combustable materials to carry  you  through  the first few evenings.  Find fresh  water and someway to hold it (open coconut shells / fashioned palm leave bowls etc) - DO NOT DRINK IT until you boil it first over your new  fire so you mitigate the risk of getting sick.  Before your first nightfall with secure fire and water taken care of, build yourself a  make shift shelter so you  are protected from the elements and yet  to be discovered critters.  

Day two, focus your  energies  gathering food  (coconuts / seaweed / clams etc) so you keep your energy high.  Once your very basic needs are met (shelter / water / food to survive), its  time to fashion a fishing pole and a sharp spear out of bamboo so you can fish  and hunt for birds to expand your  food sources.  

Day  three, focus  your energy on building yourself a more permanent shelter.   Explore the island for  wood and rock sources; along with large palm leave you  can fashion rope from.  While exploring your  new home, look for caves and / or places  where you could construct a tree fort so you can improve your protected living space.

Week 2, once your new living  quarters are secured and you have sustainable methods to care for your basic needs, climb to the highest point of the island and look for nearby islands / land and any indication of human habitation.  While searching for these indicators, assess methods of island escape to get through any surf  and start tracking wind and weather patterns daily so you can get a feel for the seasonal rotations.

Week 3 +, dedicate 3-4 hours a day to building signal fires and SOS stone messages that overheard planes may be able to detect.  It is also important  to manage your mental health and track daily changes so you keep your sanity in check  as you adjust  to the new reality.

Create a way to chronicle your experiences.  One day you  will escape your island and can sell your story to Hollywood.  Of course, if you  never do escape, you will  at  least  have the comfort of leaving something behind for eventual discovery of proof you did survive the incident that landed you on this island.",creative_writing
Write a friendly email to my teacher asking her to postpone our quiz schedule for tomorrow to next week because our basketball team is in the championship game tonight and all students will be out late celebrating our schools victory with pride!,,"Dear Mrs. Johnson, 

I'm writing to request that you move tomorrows chemistry quiz to next week's class. As you know, our school basketball team is in the conference championship tonight. Most of the student body will either be in attendance or watching on TV (until late into the night.) We expect to win and to be celebrating our wonderful schools accomplishments.

Describe a trip through the United States for a 14 day vacation in a rental car,,"The about 14 days trip through the United States starts at Las Vegas. You can easily get a direct flight from Europe to Las Vegas in the States. That makes an easy start for your trip. As you start in Las Vegas take some time to adjust and adapt to the scenery. There are a lot of things to do and see in Las Vegas itself. For example, take a walk along the strip to see all the hotels and casinos, even get inside of one - the Caesars Palace or the Venetian are very interesting. Also there are a lot of show offerings such as Cirque du Soleil or parties in the evening, if you want to have good seats it's best to book your tickets in advance before you start your trip. As you strolled through the city of Las Vegas for two days, on the third day it's time to pick up your rental car. With your rental car begins your road trip through the wide streets of the United states. The first goal for your trip will be Zion Nationalpark in Utah, about a 3 hours drive from Las Vegas. In this national park you have the chance to hike and wander around beautiful nature. One of the most impressive hikes is called Angels Landing. At the highest point of this hike you have a beautiful overview of the whole national park. But be aware that it is necessary to book your ticket for this trail way in advance or if you want to do it on short notice you have to have luck in the lottery. Otherwise you are not allowed to hike this trail. That restriction is necessary because too many people hiked the trail and it became dangerous, so numbers of hikers had to be limited a day. If you spend two day exploring the landscape of Zion Nationalpark it's time to move on to the next location, which is Bryce Canyon National Park also in Utah. It takes around two to 3 hours to drive there from Zion. The area right before the Nationalpark is small with some restaurants, hotels, motels or campgrounds. The Canyon itself is huge and will give you a lot of opportunity to explore. In the wintertime it can be very cold and snowy, therefore bring warm clothes. In the two days you spend there you can visit beautiful overviews on the edge of the canyon and also hike down and explore the deeper canyon. One of the highlights is the amphitheater or Thors' hammer. It is also recommended to watch the sun rise over Bryce Canyon because it's more spectacular from the colors than the sunset in the evening. From Bryce Canyon Nationalpark the road trip continues to the city of Page in Arizona from where you can visit the Antelope Canyon. Take at least one full day there to discover either the upper or the lower Antelope Canyon. But be aware, you have to book tickets in advance! If you don't get a ticket for them there is also Antelope Canyon X, which is a real alternative to visit and maybe even less crowded then the other ones. From this point of the tour you then drive to Grand Canyon National Park, which will take about 3 hours at least. This is probably the highlight of the National Parks in this area of the United States. Recommended is to stay at least for two days, even better if you have more time. You should take one trail down the canyon if you are in the physical state to do this. One most common way down is the south Kalib trail which has a beautiful viewpoint called Ooh Aah Point. If you want to watch the sunset in the evening the desert view watchpoint is a great way to do so. Also take some time to stroll around at Grand Canyon Village, there are some nice souvenir shops and more. From Grand Canyon National Park the road trip then moves on to the last target location, which is Los Angeles in California. It's a longer drive there and takes around 8 hours to drive there. But once you arrive there you will have some nice, relaxing days before your flight back home to Frankfurt. You can spend one day visiting Santa Monica, the beach and the Pier there. It's nice to rent a bicycle out there and ride along the beach side through Venice Beach up to Hermosa beach or even further if you like. Another activity could be to visit Dolby Theatre and the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, there are a lot of shops out there or you can just stroll along. But one thing to be aware of when visiting Los Angeles with a car is that there is always traffic and you can be stuck in traffic many times. As Los Angeles is the last stop on the proposed US-trip on your last day it is time to bring back your rental car right before you fly back, just bring it to the rental car stores at the LAX airport. From this airport you will board your flight back to Europe or somewhere else.",creative_writing

Describe a scary moment in a storm.,,"I live in Oklahoma, so we see our fair share of storms. Storm sirens are so common that I don't take cover every time they go off. Instead, it's normal for me to watch the radar when a storm system is moving through to see where the tornados are and how close they are to me. 

Once, the radar showed a tornado southwest of our house - moving towards us. When it was within a couple miles of us, my wife took the dogs and blankets and went to our safe place - an internal bathroom. I stood back from the windows and watched the tv. From my position, I could see out the back windows which faced west - southwest. The weather showed that the tornado was right on top of us. I watched out the window as a fragment of a four by four, about a foot and a half long, flipped up from the ground and tumbled across the lawn. 

It was that moment that I decided I had watched enough and stepped into the bathroom to join my wife and the dogs. The storm blew over us. The tornado wasn't on the ground as it passed by, but it was definitely and intense several minutes as we waited. 

I have seen my fair share of storms and had a number of close calls with tornados. This definitely falls in one of my top 5.",creative_writing

Eric has 4 ninja throwing stars. His friend Chad has twice as many. Then Jeff bought 2 ninja stars from Chad. Jeff now has 6 throwing stars. How many ninja throwing stars do they have altogether?,,"We know Eric has 4 stars and Chad has twice that amount, so Chad has 4 x 2 = 8 stars.
Then Chad sells 2 of them to Jeff, so Chad has 8 ??2 = <<8-2=6>>6 stars.
Altogether, Eric has 4 + Chad has 6 + Jeff has 6 = <<4+6+6=16>>16 stars.

Each dandelion produces 300 seeds. 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten by insects. Half the remainder sprout and are immediately eaten. How many dandelions survive long enough to flower?,,"First find the number of seeds that land in water: 300 seeds * 1/3 = <<300*1/3=100>>100 seeds
Then find the number of seeds that are eaten: 300 seeds * 1/6 = <<300*1/6=50>>50 seeds
Subtract the number of seeds that are destroyed to find the number that sprout: 300 seeds - 100 seeds - 50 seeds = <<300-100-50=150>>150 seeds
Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of sprouts that survive: 150 seeds / 2 = <<150/2=75>>75 seeds

Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?,,"First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml
Then repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml
Now find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g
Do the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g
Now add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g

TreShawn's mom needs to order pizza for her son and his two friends. She knows that TreShawn always eats 1/2 a pizza. His friend Michael eats 1/3 of a pizza and his other friend LaMar eats 1/6 of a pizza. How many pizzas does she need to order?,,"Half a pizza is the same as 3/6 of a pizza
1/3 of a pizza is the same as 2/6 of a pizza
3/6 of a pizza plus 2/6 of a pizza plus 1/6 of a pizza equals 6/6 of a pizza.
Therefore, she needs to buy one pizza because 6/6 equals 1

"Out of the 200 apples in an orchard, 40 percent were rotten. Also, 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled. How many rotten apples in the orchard did not smell?",,"The number of apples in the orchard which were rotten is 40/100*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80
Out of the 80 rotten apples, 70/100*80 = <<70/100*80=56>>56 were smelling.
The number of rotten apples in the orchard which were not smelling is 80-56 = <<80-56=24>>24
